##User Stories##

- As a student I want a machine with the ability to play my game creations so that I can showcase
  and share them with my peers.

- As a student I want to be able to have a guide so I can figure out how to use the machine and how
  I can get my game on the machine

- As a creator I want to know that I can safely upload my games without them being stolen or re
  uploaded to other sources so that I can continue to have it as an individual title.

- As a creator I want a server with the capability to update and deploy iterations of my game so
  that I can showcase it
