# Contributing

You can help to improve the Thoth Tech documentation by sending pull requests to this repository.
Thank you for your interest and help!

Feel free to make a proposal, we can discuss anything and if we don't agree we'll feel free not to
merge it and we'll thank you for caring about it. We want to create a welcoming environment for
everyone who is interested in contributing.

## Documentation testing

We treat documentation like code. Therefore, we use processes similar to those used for code to
maintain standards and quality of documentation.

We have tests:

- To lint the words and structure of the documentation.

### Run tests locally

You can run these tests on your local computer. This has the advantage of speeding up the feedback
loop. You can know of any problems with the changes in your branch without waiting for a CI pipeline
to run.

To run the tests locally, it's important to:

- [Install the tools](#installation)
- Run [linters](#lint-checks) the same way they are run in CI pipelines. It's important to use same
  configuration we use in CI pipelines, which can be different than the default configuration of the
  tool.

### Local linters

To help adhere to the
[documentation style guidelines](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/processes/documentation/writing-style-guide.md),
and improve the content added to documentation, [install documentation linters](#install-linters)
and [integrate them with your code editor](#configure-editors).

At Thoth Tech, we mostly use:

- [Prettier](#prettier)
- [Vale](#vale)

#### Prettier

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) checks that Markdown syntax follows the
[CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) specifications.

#### Vale

[Vale](https://docs.errata.ai/vale/about/) is a grammar, style, and word usage linter for the
English language. Vale's configuration is stored in the
[`.vale.ini`](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/blob/main/.vale.ini) file located in the
root directory.

Vale supports creating [custom tests](https://docs.errata.ai/vale/styles) that extend any of several
types of checks, which we store in the `.vale/thothtech/` directory in the documentation directory.

##### Vale result types

Vale returns three types of results:

- **Error** - For words or phrases with ambiguous meanings.
- **Warning** - For writing style preferences.
- **Suggestion** - For basic writing tenets and best practices.

##### Vale readability score

In
[`ReadingLevel.yml`](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/blob/main/docs/.vale/thothtech/ReadingLevel.yml),
we have implemented
[the Flesch-Kincaid grade level test](https://readable.com/readability/flesch-reading-ease-flesch-kincaid-grade-level/)
to determine the readability of our documentation.

As a general guideline, the lower the score, the more readable the documentation. For example, a
page that scores `12` before a set of changes, and `9` after, indicates an iterative improvement to
readability. The score is not an exact science, but is meant to help indicate the general complexity
level of the page.

The readability score is calculated based on the number of words per sentence, and the number of
syllables per word. For more information, see
[the Vale documentation](https://docs.errata.ai/vale/styles#metric).

#### Installation

#### Install prerequisites

##### macOS

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), which is a package manager for macOS that allows you to
   easily install programs and tools through the Terminal. Visit their website for installation
   instructions.
1. Follow the
   [official instructions to install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating), a
   Node version manager. Then, run the following to install and use the repository's Node version:

   ```sh
   nvm install
   nvm use
   ```

   The required Node version should be automatically detected from the `.nvmrc` file. This can be
   confirmed by running `nvm which`.

1. Install all dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

##### Windows (using WSL2)

1. Set up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and the Linux distribution. WSL allows Linux
   distributions to run on the Windows OS. Visit this
   [website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for more information.

   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```

1. Follow instructions for [Linux](#linux)

##### Linux

1. Install curl

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install curl
   ```

1. Follow the
   [official instructions to install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating), a
   Node version manager. Then, run the following to install and use the repository's Node version:

   ```sh
   nvm install
   nvm use
   ```

   The required Node version should be automatically detected from the `.nvmrc` file. This can be
   confirmed by running `nvm which`.

1. Install all dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

#### Install linters

1. Install `prettier`:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

1. Install [`vale`](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/releases). To install for:

   - macOS using `brew`, run: `brew install vale`.
   - Linux, use your distribution's package manager or a
     [released binary](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/releases).

These tools can be [integrated with your code editor](#configure-editors).

### Configure editors

Using linters in your editor is more convenient than having to run the commands from the command
line.

To configure `prettier` in your editor, install one of the following as appropriate:

- Visual Studio Code
  [`esbenp.prettier-vscode` extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).

To configure Vale in your editor, install one of the following as appropriate:

- Visual Studio Code
  [`errata-ai.vale-server` extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=errata-ai.vale-server).

### Lint checks

The following commands can be run to format all Markdown files across the entire repository:

```shell
# Format markdown style (fixing markdown style issues)
npm run format

# Lint markdown style and prose (reporting issues)
npm run lint

# Lint markdown style only
npm run format:check

# Lint prose only
npm run prose:check
```
