# Runner Dash Enemy Movement Changes

## Improvement Suggestion Description

There should be a set of options regarding enemy movement, to allow for difficulty adjustment and
player choice. These options should include whether the enemy has 8 movement directions (north,
south east, west, and diagonals) or 4 (north, south east, and west), whether the enemy can skip its
turn, how the game decides when the enemy will skip its turn (random chance vs predictable pattern),
and enemy count.

## Reasoning

Currently, the enemy will always outmaneuver the player due to it having 8 movement directions
(north, south east, west, and diagonals), while the player only has 4 (north, south east, and west).
This means that the only way to survive is to flee the enemy in a straight line until the enemy
skips a turn.

Only when the enemy skips a turn, can the player stop to plan their apprach for collecting gems.

Reducing the enemy movement directions to match the players options can be a fix, but must be
implemened alongside other changes, because this change alone would mean that the enemy can nver
catch up to the player.
