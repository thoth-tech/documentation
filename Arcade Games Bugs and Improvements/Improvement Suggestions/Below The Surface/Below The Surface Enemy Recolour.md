# Below the Surface Enemy Colors

## Improvement Suggestion Description

The color scheme of the cockroach enemy should be changed to a brighter colour.
The colour scheme of the giant rat final boss should also be reconsidered.

## Reasoning

Currently, the cockroach emeny has a dark brown color scheme, which makes it
difficult to identify because the background is a combination of a dark grey
bottom half and a somewhat lighter shad of grey for the top half. The dark
brown colour of the cockroach has very little contrast with the dark grey of
the background and is thus extremely difficult to spot.

While the lighter grey of the top half of the background does alleviate this
issue slightly, the cockroach is still very difficult to identify.

The rat final boss suffers from a similar issue, as the vast majority of the
boss is a dark brown, though the teeth, tip of the tail, and hands/feet are a
different, more easily identifed colour.
