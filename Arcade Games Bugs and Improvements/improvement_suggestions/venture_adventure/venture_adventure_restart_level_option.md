# Venture Adventure Restart Level Option

## Improvement Suggestion Description

Implement an option for the player to restart or exit the level.

## Reasoning

There should be an option of the player to restart or exit the level, as it is currently possible
for the player to move the boxes to locations that render it impossible for the player to collect
one or more gems.

Since you must collect all gems to move onto the next level, the player is then unable to progress
to the next level.

Currently, the only way to restart or exit the level while being in a situation where you are unable
to collect one or more gems is to exit out of the game entirely and reopen the program.
