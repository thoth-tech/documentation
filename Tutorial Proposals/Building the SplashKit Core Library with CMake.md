## Title: Understanding CMakeLists.txt for Building the SplashKit Core Library

As a Splashkit developer I want to learn how the CMakeLists.txt file works for building the
SplashKit core library, So that I can effectively compile and link SplashKit on various platforms
for my game development and multimedia projects.

### Introduction

This tutorial aims to provide readers with a basic understanding of the CMakeLists.txt file used for
building the SplashKit core library. CMake is a powerful build system generator that simplifies the
process of compiling and linking projects across different platforms. By the end of this tutorial,
readers will have a solid grasp of how CMakeLists.txt works for building SplashKit and will be able
to modify it for their own projects.

### Prerequisites

Readers should have:

- Basic knowledge of C++ programming language.
- Familiarity with CMake and its basic syntax.

### Functions Used

1. None

### Tutorial Details

This tutorial will provide a comprehensive explanation of the CMakeLists.txt file used to build the
SplashKit core library. It will cover directory setup, platform detection, linking libraries,
handling source files, and compiling the shared library on different platforms. The tutorial is
aimed at computer science students and programmers who want to gain a deeper understanding of CMake
and learn to customise it for their projects.

### Expected Learning Outcomes

After completing this tutorial, readers will:

- Understand the structure and purpose of CMakeLists.txt in building the SplashKit core library.
- Know how to configure CMake for different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Be able to link libraries and frameworks with the SplashKit project.
- Learn how to organise source files and include directories effectively.
- Feel confident in modifying CMakeLists.txt for their own projects.

### Conclusion

Understanding CMakeLists.txt is a valuable skill for readers interested in managing complex build
processes. By mastering the concepts presented in this tutorial, readers will be well-equipped to
work with CMake and customise it according to the requirements of their projects. So, let's delve
into the world of CMake and unleash the full potential of SplashKit in game development and
multimedia applications!
