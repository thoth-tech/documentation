# Tutorial Proposal

## Title: Getting Started With Sprite Layering In Splashkit - C#

### Introduction

A brief introduction into managing sprite layers, understanding rendering order, and organization of
sprites to create visually appealing scenes without excess Sprite / Bitmap management.

### Prerequisites

- Basic Sprite handling knowledge as outlined in 'Getting Started With Sprites In Splashkit'
- Basic programming knowledge. Understand the process of declaring and assigning variables.
  Understand what an overloaded method is. Understand argument passing and method constructing.
- Basic folder structure knowledge, at most understand how to point to a local file (for bitmap
  purposes)

### Functions Used (Link to Splashkit documentation)

1. [Create Sprite](https://splashkit.io/api/sprites/#create-sprite)
2. [Sprite Add Layer](https://splashkit.io/api/sprites/#sprite-add-layer)
3. [Bring Layer Forward ](https://splashkit.io/api/sprites/#sprite-bring-layer-forward)
4. [Sprite Bring Layer To Front](https://splashkit.io/api/sprites/#sprite-bring-layer-to-front)
5. [Sprite Hide Layer](https://splashkit.io/api/sprites/#sprite-hide-layer-named)
6. [Sprite Toggle Layer Visible](https://splashkit.io/api/sprites/#sprite-toggle-layer-visible-named)

### Table of Contents

1. **[Creation of a layered Sprite]**

   - Small overview of a practical use-case that is referenced throughout tutorial (morning/night
     background?)
   - Declaration and instantiation of a layered Sprite
   - Adding layers and hiding layers

2. **[Creation of practical use case]**

   - Show practical instantiation of previously taught concepts for a more practical use case (maybe
     for first section, use explicit sprites that are labelled for easier tutorial understanding,
     one in the corner or information drawn onto the sprite for example)
   - Highlight use cases for sprite layers (shifting background maybe)

### Tutorial Details

The structure of the tutorial will be a series of guided instructions with screenshots and code
snippets. It will be formatted in markdown for easier future porting to Docusaurus or other document
sharing services.

### Expected Learning Outcomes

The learning outcome that the reader can expect to have gained after completing this series of
tutorials is to have gained an understanding of Sprite Layering, including a theoretical
understanding of the concept including how Splashkit specifically interacts with layered sprites, as
well as a practical showcase of the concept

### Conclusion

The importance of this tutorial comes from the required ability to be able further interact with
Sprites as apart of the Splashkit library. Easing workflows and system process management via Sprite
layering rather than raw Sprite manipulation and management allows for a greater understanding of
the framework and concept as a whole and further entrenches students with the ability to use and
understand Sprites.
