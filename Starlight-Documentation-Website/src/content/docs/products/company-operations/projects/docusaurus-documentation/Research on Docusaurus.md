## Background and Introduction

A platform and open-source tool called Docusaurus by Facebook initially released in 2017. It is a
simple documentation site generator powered by React and using Markdown to produce documentation
giving flexibility to customize and make visually appealing documentation with ease. The primary
intent was to improve how easy it was to navigate through project documentation for both engineers
and end users. It is intended to make it easier for programmers to create, update, and distribute
documentation webpages as well as for end-users to conveniently navigate through project
documentation that makes it user-friendly, responsive, and intuitive documentation websites. It
blends Markdown with the strength of contemporary JavaScript frameworks like React to produce
stunning, flexible, and user-friendly documentation websites.
