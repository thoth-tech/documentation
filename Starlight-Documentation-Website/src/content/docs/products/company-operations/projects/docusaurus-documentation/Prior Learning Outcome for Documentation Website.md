title: Prior Learning Outcome for a Documentation Website

==================

**Spike:** 2

**Title:** Prior Learning Summary

**Author:** Kyle Adams, <kdadams@deakin.edu.au>

## Goals / Deliverables

The goal of this report is to reflect any prior learning from previous studies of knowledge base
technologies, and to summarize portions relevant to the current knowledge base project to support
the current workers

## Technologies, Tools, and Resources Used

- Text Editor: VsCode
- [Art Gallery Documentation Project Directory](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/tree/main/docs/ArtGallery/Documentation%20Project)

## Tasks Undertaken

- Reviewed documentations from the art gallery documentation project.
- Summarized significant details relevant to the current project.

## What we found out

### Knowledge Base Structure

The structure designs in this directory fall into three general types: grouped by frontend/backend,
grouped by project, grouped by client/developer. However, it appears that as the designs progressed,
the structure leaned more towards grouping content by project at a high level, and further
categorising documentation based on its use in each project towards the lower end of the structure.
Categorising at the lower level included by technology and by individual, but ultimately it appears
that grouping by theme was the most popular method.

### Knowledge Base Content

GitHub is repeatedly mentioned as a problem area for many newcomers, so a GitHub guide/tutorial
appears vital to include in the knowledge base. Several groups also mention the inclusion of a
'footprint' document, a document that records all suggestions for future improvements to a project
and any ideas in progress but incomplete. Finally, almost every project group appears to want
documentation that explains the technology stack involved in its workflow.

### Other Information

One suggestion briefly mentioned is that the knowledge base could be used to replace the handover
document, containing all of the necessary information for newer members to understand the project in
its current state. It is also worth mentioning that the knowledge base was intended to be utilised
by both Thoth Tech members and the clientele of the project, so reporting information and
troubleshooting for each project solution was included in the content discussion.

## Recommendations

This document recommends, based on the research and review discussed above, the following design and
creation practices:

- Separate the content between each project and further categorise content by theme of use for a
  more accessible navigation process.
- Include technology stack guides/tutorials/troubleshooting information, especially in the use of
  GitHub and the knowledge base.
- Encourage the creation of 'footprint' documents to identify any future endeavours for a given
  project, allowing members across trimesters to explore new possibilities and directions discovered
  or suggested by their predecessors.
