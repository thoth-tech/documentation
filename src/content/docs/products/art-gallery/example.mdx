### About Us

The Art Gallery is a product being created to help sell and advertise rural Art in Australia. The
project is in production not only for its artistic merits, but through its development the team at
the Art Gallery hope to showcase and introduce webapp development to newer students earlier in their
I.T. career.

This career is still in the early stages of development, so there are always exciting new
opportunities to take advantage of as the project grows and changes.
