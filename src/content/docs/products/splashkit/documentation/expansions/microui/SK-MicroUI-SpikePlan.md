# \*\*Splashkit UI Implementation

==============

**Name: Splashkit UI Implementation**

## Context
Splashkit is a library that supports multiple programming languages that aim to be beginner friendly for new programmers. At the moment, the library do have multiple functions to create UI but doesn't have the actually UI implementation yet. The purpose of this spike it investigate whether any UI framework that could integrate to the Splashkit core library.

**Knowledge Gap:**
-	it is not known if the library has the minimal requirement to run other UI library
-	The performance how running a framework on top of the Splashkit library is currently unknown for now
- Even if we got the library running on Windows, it is not known if the library can run on other operation system

The project has the library call "SDL" which is something needed to run most UI library like MicroUI.

## Goals/Deliverables

Report a confirmation whether Splashkit can be compiled MicroUI to the project

**Planned start date:** Week 5

**Deadline:** Week 6

## Planning notes


-   Setup MicroUI
-   Confirm code using SDL can be compiled with MicroUI
-   Setup the demo in the test
