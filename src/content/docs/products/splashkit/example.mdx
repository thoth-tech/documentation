### About Us

SplashKit is a C++ Software Development Kit. It is a beginner-friendly abstraction over SDL and many
other libraries to assist in introductory programming education, and can be used to create 2D games.

Through this project, this team hopes to allow students to create and publish their own interactive
experiences to share with other students and advance their own creative and professional
capabilities.
