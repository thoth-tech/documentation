### About Us

This team oversees the entire operations of Thoth Tech and strives to make things easier. We aim to
make the onboarding process as smooth and clear as possible, as well as increase the knowledge of
our seniors in meaningful ways while creating policies to improve the wellbeing of all company
employees.

In the short term, we would like to create new documentation, policies, workflows, and processes
that are relevant to improve the company's outlook and overall productivity. In the long term, we aim
to store documentations in a dedicated website (Starlight) to make it easy to push updates, new
features, and bug fixes to everyone without the need to gain access to our GitHub repository.
