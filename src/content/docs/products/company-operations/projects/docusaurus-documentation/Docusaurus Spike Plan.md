title: Docusaurus Spike Plan
---

==============

**Name:**

Docusaurus Recommendation plan

## Context

The operations team needs to determine if Docusaurus is an appropriate tool for storing Thoth tech's
documentation. It has been proposed as a better solution than just storing everything on the GitHub.
This spike outlines the steps needed to decide if this is the right solution for Thoth Tech.

**Knowledge Gap:**

any team members who are not familiar with docusaurus will need to be brought up to speed. Begin by
going through the tool's documentation which can be found at:
<https://docusaurus.io/docs/category/getting-started>

**Skill Gap:**

If team members are not up to date with syntax and technologies used by docusaurus, begin
up-skilling ASAP. W3 schools has great resources if you are unsure where to start.
<https://www.w3schools.com/>

**Technology Gap:**

Hosting and deployment need to be researched before we can deploy an instance of Docusaurus.

## Goals/Deliverables

- Create a list of reasons for Thoth tech to adopt Docusaurus, and any recommendations for using it.
- Develop a basic test environment and some sample content.

**Planned start date:** Week 2 T2 2023

**Deadline:** The end of week 2 T2 2023

## Planning notes

- Begin by up-skilling in relevant areas. (if necessary) CSS, HTML, Javascript, React and Typescript
  are the major ones.
- Create a Docusaurus test environment to test its capabilities and drawbacks.
- Get started with the Docusaurus docs page: <https://docusaurus.io/docs>
- Draw up a mock layout of the Docusaurus structure further down the line. (design pages, folders
  etc.)
