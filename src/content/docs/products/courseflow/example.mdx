### About Us

CourseFlow is a clear and easy-to-use course planning platform that helps students navigate their
course requirements and graduate with confidence.

Each year, several thousand students enrol in Deakin University. Unfortunately, a lot of these
students struggle with understanding the requirements they need to fulfil in order to graduate.

What electives do you do, have you met prerequisites or other course rules? What exactly will you
learn and benefit from a unit? Universities also have problems with putting out course-relevant
information that is easily digestible. Most information in course maps doesn't apply to students
that have transferred from other degrees or have an altered path to the original map. The team at
CourseFlow hopes to mitagate these issues through the CourseFlow platform.
