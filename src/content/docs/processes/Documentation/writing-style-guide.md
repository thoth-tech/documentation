## Formatting

### Headings

Headings should be clear and concise. All content should relate to the heading or provide links to
other information sources.

Article headings should not be in a question format.

Use h1 (#) for article headings.

### Subheadings

Subheadings are used to highlight a specific paragraph or area of content. All content should apply
to this specific subheading.

Avoid multi-tiered subheadings, use a maximum of three layers as a guide. If you need more than
three layers, consider creating a separate article.

Subheadings can be in a question format where appropriate.

Use h2 (##) or h3 (###) for subheadings. Choice depends on the layer.

### Notes

Information that is outside the scope of the content should be placed as a note if it necessary for
the reader to understand.

Content within a note should be separate from the main content, short, and to the point. A link to
more information can be provided within the note section

### Hyperlinks

Consider using hyperlinks (links) to ensure all information is relevant only to the article at hand.

When an article references information that is out of scope, the reader can be linked to other
information sources.

For example:

> One reference for Australian spelling is the
> [Macquarie Dictionary](https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/).

### Lists

The sentence leading into a list should end in a colon (:). If each item in the list is a full
sentence, capitalise the first letter and end each item with a full stop. Otherwise, if the items
are fragments of a sentence, each item should start in lowercase. Use a full stop at the end of the
last item.

#### Unordered/bullet list

An unordered list should be used when the order of the items is not important.

To create an unordered list, you should:

- end the leading sentence with a colon
- end each item with no punctuation mark
- not use a capital letter or full stop if the list items are not full sentences
- end the last item with a full stop.

To create unordered list items in markdown, use a dash (-).

#### Ordered/numbered list

An ordered list should be used when the order of the items is important, for example, step-by-step
instructions.

Follow these steps to create an ordered list:

1. You should always use a colon at the end of the leading sentence.
2. Please put list items in the right order.
3. Check that items which are full sentences have capital letters and full stops.

To create an ordered list in markdown, use a number followed by a full stop (1.).

### Text formatting

Italics is reserved for titles and legislations, or user input.

Bold is used for emphasis.

Font and text size will be relative to the html due to the nature of markdown.

### Numbers

Use words for one to nine and numerals for 10 and over

For numbers over 999, use a comma for clarity

> 25,000 or 3,000,000

Unless the number is paired with a symbol

> 3 cm or 2.75

For complex numbers, use a combination

> 2.5 million $57,800

### Sentences

The purpose of a sentence is to deliver a single message. The average sentence will have a length of
15-20 words Thoth Tech has a maximum length of 25 words.

A variety of sentence lengths will engage your reader.

Put qualifying phrases, conditions, and explanations into separate sentences.

If you want to elaborate on the same point in a new sentence, use words like 'also', 'further', or
'however'.

If there are multiple points in a single sentence, consider using several shorter sentences, dot
points, colons, or notes.

Maintain order in paragraphs.

If a sentence establishes an order, explain each item in the same order. This will help with flow
and consistency.

Avoid repetition and redundancy.

Aim for lean, efficient, and concise sentences.

## Writing

### Acronyms

Acronyms are useful to simplify a sentence.

If you use an acronym, always spell out the title at first use, followed by the acronym in brackets.

For example:

> This is the Quality Assurance (QA) process. For all QA information refer to this article.

### Capitalisation

Capital letters are to be use on proper nouns.

All writing will follow sentence case, including headings.

### Verbs

Verbs should be written in the present tense.

Be consistent with your tense.

### Active voice

Use active voice when you want the writing to be simple, direct, clear, and easy to read.

Active voice emphasises the verb.

Sentences are structured as `subject > verb > object`

Passive voice is used for feedback, preserving a relationship, and when the subject is unknown.

### Avoid nominalisation

Avoid nominalisation as it can distract the reader and make the writing dull or heavy.

Nominalisation is a type of 'abstract noun'. The name of a process, technique, or emotion.

For example:

| **Verb**    | **Nominalisation** |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Complete    | Completion         |
| Introduce   | Introduction       |
| Provide     | Provision          |
| Fail        | Failure            |
| Arrange     | Arrangement        |
| Investigate | Investigation      |
| Use         | utilisation        |

### Punctuation

| **Symbol name**    | **Symbol** | **Main use**                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| _Full stop_        | .          | End a statement or command                     |
| _Question mark_    | ?          | Ends a direct question                         |
| _Exclamation mark_ | !          | Ends an expression of emotion                  |
| _Comma_            | ,          | Separates words and groups of words            |
| _Colon_            | :          | Signals more information to come               |
| _Dash_             | &mdash;    | An informal colon                              |
| _Parentheses_      | ( )        | Enclose extra information                      |
| _Brackets_         | []         | Enclose words by someone other than the author |
| _Apostrophe_       | '          | Shows ownership or a contraction\*             |
| _Hyphen_           | -          | Joins two words to make another word           |
| _Quotation marks_  | " "        | Enclose spoken words                           |

\*Avoid using contractions.

End of sentence punctuation does not need to be included in titles, headings, subheadings, UI
titles, and lists.

### Tone

Use a conversational tone. Be brief and go straight to the point.

Edit out the terms 'you can', ' there is', 'there are', and 'there were'.

Avoid contractions.

Use the Oxford comma.

### Voice

Use second person.

For example:

> You go to the library.

## Types of writing

### Technical content

Technical content is the information about the underlying architecture, materials, and processes
required to understand existing technology. Technical content typically requires some level of
existing knowledge about the content.

Technical content should include:

- Table of contents
- Revision date
- Version ID

When writing technical content, always consider the audience's skill. Assume the reader understands
the fundamentals, but never more than that. If you are unsure, provide a link to more thorough
information.

Define technical terms in the context they are referred to and use frequently used words where
possible.

If a term already exists, do not create a new word/phrase. Use these terms consistently throughout
the article, and across Thoth Tech. Use industry specific terms when writing for a professional
audience.

### Code examples

Code examples serve a range of scenarios:

- Simple, one-line examples
- Short, self-contained examples
- Long samples with multiple features or best practice

To create useful code examples, you should identify tasks and scenarios for your audience.

Create concise examples of key development tasks, easy to read and understand. Show the expected
output within the code example.

Create sustainable and secure code examples. Follow best practice.

Ensure the code is easy to replicate and run. If possible, provide an option to copy the code
directly from the page.

### Writing instructions/steps

Instructions are used when a reader wants to learn. Therefore, the steps must be clear, easy to
understand, and follow.

Emphasis should be placed on the main direction. Use **bold** to highlight key words or phrases
which indicate the action or outcome.

Make sure the reader knows where the action should take place before you describe the action. If
necessary, provide an introductory step to highlight the area.

Throughout step-by-step instructions, formatting and language must be consistent. Capitalise the
first word of full sentences, and full stop at the end.

A separate numbered entry should be used for each step. Each step should be a complete sentence in
imperative verb form, including actions that finalise the step.

Limit the number of steps to seven, and fit all steps onto the same screen.

For single-step procedures, follow the same format, but use an unordered list instead of ordered.

When writing simple sequences, you can use `A > B > C` format. However, this should be used
sparingly due to accessibility tool limitations.

For example:

> **To increase text size of a note:**
>
> 1. On the Whiteboard, select the notes you want to increase the size.
> 2. From the toolbox, select the A+ icon until you reach the desired size. Click anywhere in the
>    Whiteboard to deselect.
>
> **To move a note:**
>
> - On the Whiteboard, click and drag the note where you want.

## Bias-free communication

When creating documentation, we have an obligation to respect all individuals. At Thoth Tech we
promote an inclusive and supportive environment. This extends to our communication.

We have a responsibility to respect diversity and promote inclusion through all our communication.
As such we enforce the following guidelines for bias-free communication.

Use gender-neutral alternatives.

| Gendered term | Substitute              |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| mankind       | humanity, people        |
| manpower      | workforce, staff        |
| manmade       | synthetic, manufactured |

Do not use gendered pronouns. Instead:

- Rewrite the sentence to use _they_, _their_, or _them_.
- Refer to a person's role.
- Use person or individual.

Exceptions include:

- if you are referring to a real person. Please use their preferred pronouns in this case.
- direct quotations and titles of works
- when gender is relevant. For example, diversity challenges.
  <!-- Would prefer a different example-->

When referring to accessibility challenges focus on people, not disabilities. For example: readers
who have low vision or blind

When creating fictitious scenarios, include a diverse range of names and roles. Do not elude to
stereotypes or generalisations and do not primarily write of Western ideals.

When including country names, be conscious of political disputes and do not mix countries states or
continents.

Do not use slang or jargon as it can be confusing or offensive for the reader. Similarly, do not use
loaded terms.

| Loaded term        | Substitute             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| master             | primary, main          |
| slave              | secondary, subordinate |
| blacklist          | denylist               |
| whitelist          | allowlist              |
| hung               | stops responding       |
| demilitarised zone | perimeter network      |

Do not use profane/derogatory terms.

## Global communication

Thoth Tech is an open-source company with a potentially global reach. We value education and
creating learning opportunities.

We have a responsibility to write and communicate in a way that is accessible via a translator, this
is a part of our global citizenship. As such we enforce the following guidelines for global
communication.

Keep your writing short and simple, break a complex sentence into multiple simple sentences. Avoid
linking more than three phrases.

Use lists and tables to reduce complexity.

Include 'that', 'who', and 'the'. These can provide clarity in the sentence structure for the reader
or translator.

Particularly for machine translation:

- Use one word for a concept and be consistent.
- Avoid -ing and -ed endings.
- Use only common abbreviations.
