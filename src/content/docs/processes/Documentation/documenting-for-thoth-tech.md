Thoth Tech prides itself on our ability to produce sustainable solutions, this can be achieved
through documentation. Documentation is an important element in the software development life cycle.
It continues throughout the entire project. It is imperative to remember, others will take over your
projects or want to learn more about how it works and why.

Documentation is offical information, provided by the company, for users and contributors.
Documentation is written for specific audiences and provides knowledge on the development lifecycle
and end product.

The Thoth Tech documentation is stored in the
[documentation repositry](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation)., in the company GitHub. All
documentation should be written in markdown and includes: research, meeting minutes, software user
guides, and more.
