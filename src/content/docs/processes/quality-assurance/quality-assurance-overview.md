## Why/What is Quality Assurance?

Quality Assurance (QA) is defined as a procedure to ensure the quality of software products or
services provided to the customers by an organisation. Quality assurance focuses on improving the
software development process and making it efficient and effective as per the quality standards
defined for software products.

## Software Development and Testing

The [Testing and Development processes document](testing-and-dev.md) contains information and
resources relating to the software conception and development process and documentation. It also
explains the test driven development (TDD) process and contains information relating to feature
development using this approach. As it makes testing part of the approach, it is best to be familiar
with this document before you start coding.

It covers key areas including:

- [Feature development: where do I start?](testing-and-dev.md#feature-development-where-do-i-start)
- [Epics and User Stories](testing-and-dev.md#epics-and-user-stories)
- [Software Requirements Specification Document](testing-and-dev.md#software-requirements-specification-document)

- [Testing and Development](testing-and-dev.md#testing-and-development)

  - [Test Strategy](testing-and-dev.md#test-strategy)

  - [Test Plans](testing-and-dev.md#making-a-test-plan)
  - [Testing Tools](testing-and-dev.md#testing-tools)
  - [Test Driven Development](testing-and-dev.md#test-driven-development)
  - [Testing Templates](testing-and-dev.md#testing-templates)

## Git Contribution Guide

The [Git Contributions Guide](git-contribution-guide.md) concerns processes relating to the git
workflow, branching and commit formatting guidelines and draft pull requests.

Key areas are:

- [Contributing to Repositories: How To](git-contribution-guide.md#contributing-to-repositories-how-to)

- [Branching Guidelines](git-contribution-guide.md#branching-guidelines)

- [Commit Guidelines](git-contribution-guide.md#commit-guidelines)
  - [Commit Message Format](git-contribution-guide.md#message-format)
- [Code Review Guidelines](git-contribution-guide.md#code-review-guidelines)

- [Git Workflow Summary](git-contribution-guide.md#git-workflow-summary)
