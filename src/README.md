# src

## Purpose  
The `src` directory contains the primary content and styling files used in the project. It is divided into two main folders: `content` and `styles`.

## Directory Structure  
### 1. `content/`  
This folder contains documentation-related content categorized into multiple subdirectories:
- **docs/**: The main directory for documentation, subdivided into:
  - `policies`: Contains policies and guidelines, such as onboarding and management.
  - `processes`: Covers various workflows, including documentation, templates, cybersecurity, and quality assurance.
  - `products`: Includes details about the organization's projects (e.g., OnTrack, SplashKit).
  - `reference`: Contains reference materials and examples.
  - `teams-and-leadership`: Stores information about organizational structure, leadership, and team members.

### 2. `styles/`  
This folder includes styling files for the project:
- **custom.css**: The main CSS file used for styling.
- **env.d.ts**: TypeScript environment configuration for styling.

## Notes  
- All file names within this directory follow the **snake_case** convention for consistency.
- Make sure to update relevant files and README.md entries when adding new content or directories.
