## What is this repository used for?

Welcome to the **ThothTech Documentation** repository! This repository is designed as the dynamic
hub for all short-term documentation needs within Thoth Tech. It provides a structured and
accessible platform for managing the fluid and frequently updated documents that support our team's
agile project management and development cycles.

**Short-term documentation** such as spike reports, meeting minutes, and sprint reports are
primarily housed here. These documents are crucial for capturing the fast-paced changes in our
projects and ensuring that all team members are kept up-to-date with the latest developments and
decisions.

For **long-term documentation**, including onboarding materials, general product guidelines, and
detailed records of company deliverables, please refer to our
[ThothTech Documentation Website](https://github.com/thoth-tech/ThothTech-Documentation-Website)
repository. This separate repository is dedicated to maintaining stable and ongoing documentation
that supports long-term knowledge management and resource sharing across the company.
