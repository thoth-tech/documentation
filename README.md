## What is this repositry used for?

This documentation repo is used to collate all information regarding the Thoth Tech Products. Every project needs good documentation and Thoth Tech's mission is to ensure there are good documentation paradigms in place which would set the company up for success in the future. 

Each team has their own separate repository and these are supposed to be used for anything related to the team projects. Additionally, if you have documentation elsewhere, we recommend that you begin a small migration process to this repository within a .md format.

Some of the things you might want to include within this repositry includes: 

* Meeting Minutes
* Research and Findings
* Onboarding Packages
* And more - the potential is unlimited.

Please note, before you commit any changes to this repositry, take the time to explore the layout and setup, as the files and folder structure has already been setup on GitHub.
