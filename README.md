This documentation repository is used to collate all information regarding the Thoth Tech Products.

documentation paradigms in place which would set the company up for success in the future.

Each team has their own separate folders and these are used for everything related to the team
projects. Additionally, if you have documentation elsewhere, we recommend that you begin a small
migration process to this repository in Markdown format.
