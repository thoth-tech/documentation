# CourseFlow pitch script

## The Hook

Are you feeling lost and overwhelmed with the maze-like university course maps?

Do you find yourself constantly struggling to navigate through the endless lists of requirements and
prerequisite? If so, you are not alone.

## The Problem

Each year, several thousand students enrol in Deakin University. Unfortunately, a lot of these
students struggle with understanding the requirements they need to fulfil in order to graduate. What
electives do you do, have you met prerequisites or other course rules? What exactly will you learn
and benefit from in a unit?

Universities also have problems with putting out course-relevant information that is easily
digestible. Most information in course maps doesn't apply to students that have transferred from
other degrees or have an altered path to the original map.

CourseFlow is a clear and easy-to-use course planning platform that helps students navigate their
course requirements and graduate with confidence.

## The Solution

CourseFlow is a tool designed to ease the frustrations of both students and universities by offering
a user-friendly course-planning experience. With an intuitive UI, students can easily create a
customized course map tailored to their specific needs, allowing them to visually track their
progress and see how units relate to one another. CourseFlow takes into account important factors
such as electives, prerequisites, and study load, while also generating a skills summary based on
the units taken.

## The Product Demo

While there are other course planners on the market, our platform distinguishes itself by providing
a unit discovery feature which displays all available units and courses listed in the handbook and
their requirements visually on a map, making it more accessible and convenient for users. CourseFlow
includes a timetable generation feature, which automatically checks your unit selections against
your course rules, ensuring that you're on track to meet your degree requirements. It also has a
data analytics feature which summarizes the skills you have learnt and key information about your
course progress.

## Market Size

At Deakin this project has the potential to assist over 66,000 students. In the long term this
project can extend further into all universities across Australia and help even more.

## Call for Action

We welcome anyone with any skillset and experience. As this is a new project, we are looking for
