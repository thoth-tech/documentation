- Timetable generation feature, showing what units you need to complete in each trimester up until
  graduation. Takes into consideration prerequisite units, and the trimesters each unit runs in.

- Course rule checking. When selecting units for the course map, students will be warned if they are
  violating a course rule (e.g.: not selecting all core units, incompatible units, missing
  prerequisites, not enough electives)

- Unit suggestion

- Remaining units/coursepoints to achieve degree. Estimated time to completion based on current
  trajectory. Way for students to see changes in their trajectory based on changes in their
  coursemap.

- Intuitive user interfaces.
