## Description

This tutorial extends upon the Getting Started with Servers tutorial by adding in how you can handle
different requests as well as multiple requests at the same time to different html pages within the
project. It also gives a brief explanation on adding links to the html pages to navigate between
them.

The program code was tested for each language, issues were identified in the C++ version of code in
the recap part where it used `web_server` instead of `start_web_server` which has been now fixed. In
addition the C# code in checking requests was updated to instead use top level statements.

- I think there is potential to extend the adding links area and building different html pages.
  Although this could be a separate tutorial.
