## Description

This tutorial covers how to create a basic web server using SplashKit, as well as how to create
`skm resources` for making a website. The tutorial goes over how to create a basic web server that
can display "Hello World" as well as one that will display the `index.html` file created during the
tutorial.

The program code was tested for each language, issues were identified in the C++ version of code
where in step 3 and in step 4 it used `web_server` instead of `start_web_server` which has been now
fixed.
