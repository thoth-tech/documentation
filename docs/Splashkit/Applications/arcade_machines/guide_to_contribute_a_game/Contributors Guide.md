## Coding

To make the game accessible and controllable by the arcade machine, some additional code or changes
are required.

### Quit Request

Your game must be able to be exited using the escape key. This can be achieved by including the
following command in your main loop.

```cpp
int main()
{
    while(!key_down(ESCAPE_KEY))
    {
        // game play
    }
}
```

### Window Size

The window size of your game cannot exceed 1600 x 900, this is to allow your game to sit neatly
inside the arcade-machine itself. Similarly, there is a minimum window size of 640 x 480, to ensure
visibility for the user.

The window size of your game cannot exceed 1600 x 900, this is to allow your game to sit neatly
inside the arcade-machine itself. Similarly, but mainly for aesthetic purposes, a minimum window
size of 640 x 480 is expected.

### Window Border

We ask that you remove the border before compiling your game. The Arcade Machine provides a more
immersive experience for the user if there is no border. To remove the border of your game window,
use SplashKit’s `window_toggle_border();` function after the `open_window()` function like so:

```cpp
int main()
{
    open_window("my game", width, height);
    window_toggle_border("my game");
}
```

## Controls

## Compiling

Only Windows compiled games are supported at the moment.

(TBA - Brief windows compilation explanation)

## Artwork

A preview of your game will be shown in the Arcade Machine games menu.

(TBA - Please include an image of your game)

This image must be sized as 600px x 540px so it will be displayed correctly in the games menu. The
supported formats are `png`, `jpg` and `bmp`.

If you don’t have access to image editing software such as Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop, we suggest
you use a browser-based tool such as [resizeimage](https://resizeimage.net/) to resize, crop or
format a screenshot of your game.

## Configuration

Each game must have a configuration file containing information about the game. There is a
`config.txt` file located in the base directory of the repository, copy this file into the base
directory of your game file and fill it with your game information. It must match the example
configuration file shown below, but with your game information.

The configuration file **must** be in text (`.txt`) format, and it must be named `config.txt`. This
must be located in your games root directory, alongside your `program.cpp` (example below).
