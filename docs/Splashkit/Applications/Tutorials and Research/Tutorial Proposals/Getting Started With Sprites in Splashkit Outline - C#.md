# Tutorial Proposal

## Title: Getting Started With Sprites in Splashkit Outline - C#

### Introduction

A brief introduction into handling Sprites - specifically X/Y positioning, with an initial beginner
focus on drawing a sprite to the screen, as well as accessing and modifying sprite positional data
based off of X and Y coordinates over time, with a section of general outline of Sprite handling
theory, methods, and modes of thinking in relation to Sprites in Splashkit.

### Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge. Understand the process of declaring and assigning variables.
  Understand what an overloaded method is. Understand argument passing and method constructing.
- Basic folder structure knowledge, at most understand how to point to a local file (for bitmap
  purposes)

### Functions Used (Link to Splashkit documentation)

1. [Create Sprite](https://splashkit.io/api/sprites/#create-sprite)
2. [Draw Sprite](https://splashkit.io/api/sprites/#group-draw-sprite)
3. [Move Sprite To](https://splashkit.io/api/sprites/#move-sprite-to)
4. [Sprite X](https://splashkit.io/api/sprites/#sprite-x)
5. [Sprite Y](https://splashkit.io/api/sprites/#sprite-y)

### Table of Contents

1. **[Understanding Sprites in Splashkit]**

   - Basic process of instantiating bitmap and sprite objects
   - Understanding overloaded methods of above

2. **[Placing Sprites into a Splashkit window]**

   - Using Create Sprite, Draw Sprite, and Move Sprite To to see our sprite and modify position

3. **[Using Splashkit to move our Sprite around]**

   - Construction of some basic small program to showcase active runtime modification of Sprite
     positioning and drawing. Maybe showcase multiple sprites, or maybe a random movement of a
     single sprite.

### Tutorial Details

The structure of the tutorial will be a series of guided instructions with screenshots and code
snippets. It will be formatted in markdown for easier future porting to Docusaurus or other document
sharing services.

### Expected Learning Outcomes

The learning outcome that the reader can expect to have gained after completing this series of
tutorials is to have a basic understanding of Sprite assertion and manipulation, so as to be able to
use Sprites in their own projects.

### Conclusion

The importance of this tutorial comes from the almost ubiquitous required ability to be able to
interact with Sprites in the process of making games. Splashkit being a visual-focused and friendly
game making frontend, understanding how to interact with that visual medium via Sprites as a
baseline is important.
