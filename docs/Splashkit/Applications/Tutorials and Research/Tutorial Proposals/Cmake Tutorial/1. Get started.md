## Title: Getting Started With Sprite Layering In Splashkit - C++
Welcome to this CMake tutorial. We'll cover the fundamental features of CMake, a project management tool used to guide the compilation process for various operating systems. CMake is commonly employed for tasks like library management and software testing to ensure proper functionality.
### Install Pre-requisites

- Download and Install MSYS in https://www.msys2.org/
- prompt these commands:
>pacman -S git --noconfirm --disable-download-timeout
>bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splashkit/skm/master/install-scripts/skm-install.sh)
- prompt "skm" ensure everything is good to go
- Install compilers:
>pacman --disable-download-timeout -S mingw-w64-{x86_64,i686}-gcc mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-gdb
- Install cmake and make:
>pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
>pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-make
