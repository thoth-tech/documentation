## Title: Building the SplashKit Core Library with CMake

  

### Introduction

  

In this tutorial we are going the cover how to build splashkit core library in our project using Cmake. Splashkit-core already had a pre-made `CmakeLists.txt` file in `splashkit-core\projects\cmake`. Feel free to explore and tinker the setting over there.
  

### Build and test

- fork and clone splashkit:

>git clone --recursive -j2 https://github.com/<username>/splashkit-core.git

[I have made a script that automatically run everything below, check "issue troubleshot and other things (On windows)"]

- Change directory and run cmake:

>cd projects/cmake

>cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .

- prompt "make" to build the test file

make

- Change directory to bin

>cd ../../bin

- run the test and enjoy

>./sktest

  

### Make changes or addition to the test

If you like to add feature or make changes to the test file feel free to hop in "splashkit-core\coresdk\src\test" and make changes there. For the menu changes (assume that is what you are looking for ), you can either you can add a new cpp file, add the header in "test_main.h" then change the menu in "test_main.cpp" or change the "test_main.cpp" code in your hearts desire then rerun the cmake and make above.

  

### issue troubleshot and other things (On windows)

- If you encounter an error "#include <cstdint>" in "networking.h" just hop into "splashkit-core\coresdk\src\coresdk"

open up "networking.h" and include the cstdint library there

- If you encounter an error for "___darwin_check_fd_set_overflow" just go to the "CMakeLists.txt" and comment out all of the "target_link_options(skunit_tests PUBLIC "LINKER:-U,___darwin_check_fd_set_overflow")". This is a linker for MacOS, so for us windows it is not a necessity

- Incase your terminal requires you to change the require minimum version of cmake, just change 3.2 to 3.5 in the Cmakelist file

- I have made a script file where it runs cmake, make and test automatically. Copy it to the "splashit-core" folder and run "./run.sh" using MSYS2 Mingw64 (You welcome :3).
