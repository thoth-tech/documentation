One significant issue identified is the excessive speed of meteorites, which has a notable impact on the game's difficulty and player engagement.

## Testing Goals

- Evaluate gameplay mechanics and balance.
- Assess graphics quality and performance.
- Test user interface design and intuitiveness.
- Identify and report bugs and usability issues.

## Testing Environment

- Testing Tools: Arcade machine

## Test Cases

The following test cases were executed during the testing phase:

### Test Case 1: Meteorite Speed
- Description: Evaluate the speed of meteorites during gameplay.
- Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch the game.
2. Start a new game session.
3. Observe the speed at which meteorites move across the screen.
- Expected Result: Meteorite speed is challenging yet manageable, allowing players to navigate effectively.
- Actual Result: Meteorites move at an excessive speed, making it difficult for players to react and avoid collisions.

## Bugs/Issues

### Issue: Excessive Meteorite Speed
- Description: During gameplay, it was observed that the meteorites move at an excessively high speed, leading to an increase in game difficulty beyond the intended level.
- Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch the game.
2. Start a new game session.
3. Observe the speed at which meteorites move across the screen.

- Notes: The rapid movement of meteorites makes it challenging for players to react and navigate effectively, impacting the overall gameplay experience. This issue is particularly noticeable on higher levels, where it becomes nearly impossible to avoid collisions due to the meteorites' speed.

**Proposed Solution:**
The meteorite speed needs to be adjusted to provide players with a fair and engaging gameplay experience. By reducing the speed to a more manageable level, players will have better control over their ship's movements and can effectively strategize to avoid collisions. This adjustment will maintain a challenging aspect while not compromising the core enjoyment of the game.

**Testing Required:**
1. Implement adjustments to meteorite speed.
2. Conduct thorough playtesting to ensure the new speed level provides an appropriate balance of challenge and enjoyment.
3. Gather player feedback to validate the changes and assess whether the meteorite movement feels more balanced.

**Impact:**
This issue significantly affects the game's playability and enjoyment. Addressing the meteorite speed will enhance the overall experience and encourage players to engage with the game for longer periods. Failure to address this issue could result in player frustration, leading to reduced player retention and potential negative reviews.

## Performance Evaluation

Performance evaluation revealed no significant issues. The game maintained a stable frame rate even during intense gameplay moments, and load times were within acceptable limits.

## User Experience (UX) Evaluation

The overall user experience was positive. However, the excessive meteorite speed issue has negatively impacted the user experience by making the game overly challenging.

## Suggestions and Feedback

- Address the excessive meteorite speed issue to enhance gameplay balance.
- Visual Feedback: Provide clearer visual cues when the player's ship is hit by a meteorite.   This can include visual effects, screen shakes, or sound effects to enhance the impact and improve feedback to the player.
- Power-ups and Abilities: Consider introducing power-ups or special abilities that the player can acquire during gameplay.  These could include temporary shields, slow motion, or increased firepower, adding variety and strategic depth to the gameplay.

## Conclusion

The testing process has revealed several strengths of the Asteroids, including its intuitive controls and engaging gameplay. However, the issue of excessive meteorite speed poses a significant challenge to player enjoyment and needs to be promptly addressed. By implementing the proposed solution, the game can provide a more balanced and enjoyable experience for players.
