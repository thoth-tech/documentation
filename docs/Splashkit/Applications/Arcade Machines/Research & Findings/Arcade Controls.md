## About Controls

Two `joysticks` and `buttons` are controls found on the deck of the arcade machine. Specifically,
there are nine (9) `buttons` on the deck. Six of these are positioned on the right side of each of
the `joysticks` (**JS**), marked with letters A to F. Lastly, the `start` button at the top-centre
of the deck with the `player 1` and `player 2` buttons at the left and right-hand side of it. See
the _UI mockup_ below.

## User Story

| Label               | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Description         | Players use a joystick and buttons in the deck of the arcade machine to start, control, pause and end actions of the objects on the arcade machineâ€™s screen.                                                                                                    |
| User story          | As a player, I want to use game controls to play games on the Deakin School of IT's arcade machine.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Acceptance criteria | (1) a player should not be able to interact with (or play) a game without pressing the `start` button (or inserting a coin). (2) These controls must be the only user interface a player has with the game in the arcade machine. (3) Code testing is required. |
| Data validation     | (1) Ensure that the arcade machine is connected to the power and switched on. (2) Ensure that games are loaded on the machine. (3) Confirm whether a `start` button has been engaged (or a coin has been inserted).                                             |

## API or Code

A possible implementation for reading controls from JSON file

```cpp
public class Controls
{
    private static Json _controls_json;

    public Controls()
    {
        _controls_json = SplashKit.JsonFromFile("Controls.json");
    }

    public static KeyCode Keylookup(string key)
    {
        if (!_controls_json.HasKey(key)) return KeyCode.UnknownKey;

        if (Enum.IsDefined(typeof(KeyCode), _controls_json.ReadString(key))) {
            return Enum.Parse<KeyCode>(_controls_json.ReadString(key));
        }

        return KeyCode.UnknownKey;
    }
}
```
