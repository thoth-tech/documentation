<systemList>
	<!-- Here's an example system to get you started. -->
	<system>

		<!-- A short name, used internally. Traditionally lower-case. -->
		<name>pc</name>

		<!-- A "pretty" name, displayed in menus and such. -->
		<fullname>PC</fullname>

		<!-- The path to start searching for ROMs in. '~' will be expanded to $HOME on Linux or %HOMEPATH% on Windows. -->
		<path>/home/deakin/Games/LaunchScripts</path>

		<!-- A list of extensions to search for, delimited by any of the whitespace characters (", \r\n\t").
		You MUST include the period at the start of the extension! It's also case sensitive. -->
		<extension>.exe .sh</extension>

		<!-- The shell command executed when a game is selected. A few special tags are replaced if found in a command:
		%ROM% is replaced by a bash-special-character-escaped absolute path to the ROM.
		%BASENAME% is replaced by the "base" name of the ROM.  For example, "/foo/bar.rom" would have a basename of "bar". Useful for MAME.
		%ROM_RAW% is the raw, unescaped path to the ROM. -->
		<command>%ROM%</command>

		<!-- The platform to use when scraping. You can see the full list of accepted platforms in src/PlatformIds.cpp.
		It's case sensitive, but everything is lowercase. This tag is optional.
		You can use multiple platforms too, delimited with any of the whitespace characters (", \r\n\t"), eg: "genesis, megadrive" -->
		<platform>PC</platform>

		<!-- The theme to load from the current theme set.  See THEMES.md for more information.
		This tag is optional. If not set, it will default to the value of <name>. -->
		<theme>N64</theme>
