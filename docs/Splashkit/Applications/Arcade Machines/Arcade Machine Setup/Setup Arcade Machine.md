### Setup WiFi Access Point (Optional)

This will set the PI up as a WiFi Access Point so you can SSH in when the USB ports are not
accessible Basic Guide Availble Here https://gist.github.com/narate/d3f001c97e1c981a59f94cd76f041140

Enter the following commands, the SSID is set to Arcade1 chagne the number for the macine you are
working on

nmcli con add type wifi ifname wlan0 con-name Hostspot autoconnect yes ssid Arcade1
nmcli con modify Hostspot 802-11-wireless.mode ap 802-11-wireless.band bg ipv4.method shared
nmcli con modify Hostspot wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-psk
nmcli con modify Hostspot wifi-sec.psk "GamesAreFun"
nmcli con up Hostspot
```

The Pi will now be broadcasting a WiFi network called Arcade1 with the password GamesAreFun
