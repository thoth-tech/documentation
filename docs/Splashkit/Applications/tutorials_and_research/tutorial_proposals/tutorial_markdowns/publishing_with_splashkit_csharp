# Publishing in SplashKit - C# / C++

## Sharing created programs

So let's say you've made something. Congragulations! But, you probably want to be able to send this
to someone for whatever reason without guiding them through a compile instruction process, or the
entire SplashKit install procedure, or send through any individual assets, or any other numbers of
more complicated than just sending a folder methods.

In previous guides, you might have seen usage of `skm dotnet run` or `skm clang++ program.cpp` to
compile programs, this guide intends to go a little more in-depth as to the nature of publishing and
sharing compiled and published programs.

Let's take the following code snippet in C# as an example:

```c#
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {   //Window Creation
        Window baseWindow = new Window("publishing!", 800, 800);

        baseWindow.DrawCircle(Color.Black, 400, 400, 100);
        SplashKit.RefreshScreen();
        SplashKit.Delay(2000);
    }
}
```

You can run the code if interested, but it's just a simple program that opens a window, draws a
SplashKit generated circle, and then quits. What's important about this code snippet is that it has
no external object references, so we're not loading in any files such as bitmaps, or audio or
animation files, or anything else SplashKit might let us use.

If you were to run `skm dotnet publish`, a folder would be created in the directory of the
accompanying source code called `bin`, and then a further folder called `debug` holds our created
`program.exe` file. It's safest to share the entire debug folder, especially in reference to the
upcoming behavior and section of the guide.

## Sharing created programs with assets

Now if you were to copy the above steps, but in a piece of code that does explicitly reference
object pointers that get read in by SplashKit for local files, such as Bitmap instantiations, you
would see a lot of errors pop up in the console accompanying your `program.exe` saying something
akin to:

```
Unable to locate file for {sprite} ({filepath})
```

Where sprite and filepath would be your locally referenced bitmap and filepath respectively. What's
important to know is that SplashKit doesn't transfer over these resources during the publishing
process. In order to remedy this as an example, just copy over your `images` folder that we
described in an earlier guide (that would house all of your bitmaps for instantiation) into the
debug/netx.0 folder manually.

This trend runs true for both C# and C++, compiling and publishing via `skm dotnet publish` for C#
and `skm clang++ program.cpp -o program.exe` will both require manual copying of any imported assets
into the shared root folder of an associated .exe file.
