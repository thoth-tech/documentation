# Tutorial Proposal

## Title: Getting Started: C++, C#, Python, and Pascal - Windows

### Introduction

A brief introduction into creating a splashkit project for all 4 supported languages, marked by
successful use of the `skm new` command on windows as well as a successful compile call.

### Prerequisites

- Basic computer knowledge. Ability to install files, run commands from a Command Line
- Basic troubleshooting abilities, PATH environment variable editing (will be covered in the
  tutorial but useful to have pre-existing knowledge)

### Functions Used (Link to Splashkit documentation)

1. [Write](https://splashkit.io/api/terminal/#write)

### Table of Contents

1. **[Installing and compiling a C++ Splashkit programme on windows]**

   - Installation of the MSYS2 terminal
   - Installation of the Splashkit SDK
   - Installation of Visual Studio Code / Language Tools
   - Hello World compile

2. **[Installing and compiling a C# Splashkit programme on windows]**

   - Installation of the MSYS2 terminal
   - Installation of the Splashkit SDK
   - Installation of Visual Studio Code / Language Tools
   - Hello World compile

3. **[Installing and compiling a Python Splashkit programme on windows]**

   - Installation of the MSYS2 terminal
   - Installation of the Splashkit SDK
   - Installation of Visual Studio Code / Language Tools
   - Hello World compile

4. **[Installing and compiling a Pascal Splashkit programme on windows]**

   - Installation of the MSYS2 terminal
   - Installation of the Splashkit SDK
   - Installation of Visual Studio Code / Language Tools
   - Hello World compile

   Maybe consolidate first two/three steps into a single tutorial, it would just be copy-pasting the
   first parts of each to every other otherwise. Maybe that would be OK though, given that it's
   meant to be beginner-focused, having copies of the same beginner friendly installation
   instructions might not be that bad?

   1. **[Installing MSYS2 and Splashkit SDK on windows]**

   - Installation of the MSYS2 terminal
   - Installation of the Splashkit SDK

   2. **[Installing Visual Studio Code / FreePascal(?) on windows]**

   - Installation of Visual Studio Code
   - More research to be done on Pascal installation and compilation processes, have got every other
     langauge down except this one, FreePascal is an IDE and Compiler, trying to see if it can be
     rooted into VSCode, as well as how to get splashkit to be identified successfully without
     compile errors

   3. **[Hello Splashkit on windows]**

   - C++ Hello World compile tutorial
   - C# Hello World compile tutorial
   - Python Hello World compile tutorial
   - Pascal Hello World compile tutorial

### Tutorial Details

The structure of the tutorial will be a series of guided instructions with screenshots and code
snippets. It will preferably be formatted in markdown, but further discussion regarding this has to
take place. The target audience will be absolute beginners, with little pre-knowledge outside of
general computer use expected.

### Expected Learning Outcomes

The learning outcome that the reader can expect to have gained after completing this series of
tutorials is to be able to go from nothing to be able to compile splashkit programmes with different
languages. This gives them the tools and abilities to compile files for later use in tutorials and
general overall use of the program, as well as facilitate different language usage and learning.

### Conclusion

The importance of this tutorial comes from the required ability to be able to install, as well as
compile splashkit programmes in multiple languages. This will benefit the readers by giving them the
necessary baseline to be able to learn more and facilitate real-world projects via installation of
the Splashkit SDK, IDEs and Language Tools, and a practical understanding of the compiling pipeline.
