## Discussion

### Build a cool game

- running through turning things into markdown files and creating PR’s.

  doubling up when going to record a reference video (hopefully tomorrow)

  actions to find their game.

- Sarah suggested the carousel be an Eternal Carousel with
  - Option to change background image
  - Option to change background music
  - Option to change selector sound
  - Option to change game menu view

- Arcade machine will need a ‘Start’ button to exit a game when playing? (Alternatively, player uses
  ESC to escape)
- Quickly discussing which class would be responsible for drawing the assets, button class or grid
