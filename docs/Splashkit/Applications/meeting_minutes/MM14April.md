## Announcements

[14/04/2022 11:41 am] TALIA ZIDAR Important!

### Have you finished the design stage?

Hi General,

I know I said that you should start working on development this week, but first please double check
you are ready. It is important that everyone on the team is on board, ready, and the plan is
correct. Ideally you should go through this checklist with EVERY new task you start (that's how you
work in Agile)

Here is a checklist to double check your team is ready:

- What is the goal of the team (epic)?
- Have you identified User Stories (around 5+)? Put them in Trello or in GitHub documentation repo
- Have you completed the Software Requirements Specification documents (the information will come
  out of the user stories) This is needed for 6.2 task
- Have you filled the backlog based on the SRS?
- Is this backlog related to the goal?
- Are all your members aligned across the whole team and product lead?
- Does your plan align with the goal?
- Remember documentation is a deliverable in itself.

## Discussion

- SRS draft completion
- User stories uploaded to Trello
- Testing Strategies
  - one for each arcade machine and build a game (software and hardware)
- GitHub - MD files need to convert meeting minutes
  - and other important documents once approved

### Build a cool game

- Next meet on Tuesday at 6PM to discuss testing strategies
- and how we are going to record them

### Arcade Machine

- Hardware requirement Planning

## Action Items

- [ ] Everyone: SRS file, draft complete and sent for feedback
- [ ] Everyone: Update trello
- [ ] Everyone: Start file conversion to GitHub (docs to md files)
- [ ] Everyone: Retrospective (only covered briefly at the end as we ran out of time)
