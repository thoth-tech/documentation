Level building guidelines

To build water elements:

1.  Place an empty hold/turn/multi turn pipe down

2.  Place a holdpipe/turnpipe/multiturnpipe down that is the same as the empty pipe

3.  Place the water over/under it on another layer (ex: empty pipe on layer 1, water on the same
    tile on layer 2)

- Use regular pipes to connect it all together

To build a level:

4.  Place blue and pink players on layer 1

5.  Place the door on layer 1

6.  Use half blocks for decoration or test if they can be used, but have alternatives

7.  Make sure ladders are all on the same layer!

8.  Only use half blocks and diagonal blocks decoratively

9.  Make sure to have the latest build of both the game and the level editor
