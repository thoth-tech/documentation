# Data Analytics Epic

## Background / Context

SplashKit is a live product, which can be improved as per valid suggestions and observations. The
addition of Data Analytics is one of the recognised areas for improvement.

## Business Value

The addition of Data Analytics into SplashKit enables more focused classes to be designed for data
science students, rather than only using SplashKit for building games.

## In Scope

- SplashKit Core SDK (program code for the feature)
- SplashKit.io (articles on usage of the feature)

## Out of Scope

- SplashKit Translator
- SKM

## What needs to happen

- Review the code from previous trimesters to determine if any of the existing data frames code can
  be reused
- Re-create the expected functionality of data frames, including capabilities to perform the loading
  of structured data, multiple data types, data modification and cleaning, standardisation,
  transformation, feature selection, feature extraction, and descriptive statistics
- Expand the functionality so that the user can visualise data with customizable parameters through
  pie-charts, bar graphs, etc. (potentially through the existing SplashKit drawing modules)
- Produce documentation for the usage of the module
- Assess the potential for integration with the machine learning module

## Assumptions / Dependencies

- Everything is customizable by the user (for example, the colours in visualisations)
- Previous contribution code is accessible and working

## UX/UI Considerations

N/A

## Analytics Considerations

None known

## Regulation & Compliance Considerations

N/A

## Operations / Support / Training Considerations

- Team members must become familiar with SplashKit, C++, Ninja and CMake
- Advise teams 2 weeks in advance of planned release

## Acceptance criteria

- Successful addition of being able to load, record, analyse, and visualize the correct data that is
  desired by the users
- Functional and passing QA
- Easy to use (user acceptance testing completed)
- Documentation completed for design decisions and work
- Documentation fits current expectations as set by SplashKit.io and stakeholders
