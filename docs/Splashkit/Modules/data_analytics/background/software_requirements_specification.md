# Software Requirement Specification (SRS) Document Template

## 1. Introduction

The purpose of Data Analytics module is to allowing users to load datasets from various file
formats, then perform data manipulations and visualization for the goal of extracting useful
insights from the dataset.

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of Data Analytics module is that it is a tool that allows users to import, create data
visualisations, and use pre-written algorithms to perform statistical analysis of the data, and
pre-process data for use in a machine learning model.

### 1.2 Intended Audience

The intended audience is Data Analysts, Machine Learning Engineers, and developers.

### 1.3 Intended Use

The intended use of this module is to create data visualisations and preprocess the data to be used
in a machine learning model.

### 1.4 Scope

- Create dataframes by importing datasets. Adding and removing rows/columns in a dataset.
- Changing data inside a dataset.
- Preprocessing functionality for cleaning and standardising the dataframe for the goal of making it
  fit to be used in a machine learning model.
- Create data visualisations like bar graphs, histograms.

### 1.5 Definitions and Acronyms

- Dataset: A collection of data in tabular form. Files ending in comma separated values (.csv), tab
  separated values (.tbv), Excel (.xlsx), test (.txt) file extension.
- Dataframe: Representation of dataset as an object in the program which allows users to use method
  calls to perform actions on the dataset.
- Standardising: the process of converting data to a common format to enable users to process and
  analyse it
