# Scope for Data Analytics Module

The scope for the data analytics module depends on the finalisation of reviews for the code.

## Previous Scope

### Completed

These are things that were listed as completed, some of these things seem like they were never done
but ticked off.

- Functions to read in structural dataset
  - Column by column indicated by the programmer/computer scientist
  - Row by row indicated by the programmer/computer scientist
- Data management design for the analysed datasets
  - Dataframe
- Data pre-processing capabilities
  - Reading data from files
  - Data cleaning

### To Do

#### 2022

- Data pre-processing capabilities
  - Instance selection
  - Data standardization
  - Data transformation
  - Feature extraction and selection
  - Create MATLAB-like clear data input space, load data, visualisation, statistics, plots, subplots

#### Ongoing

- 1 year: across two trimesters for data visualisation plotting framework – data distribution and
  central tendencies – functions for plotting 2D plots and axes formatting.
- 1.5 years: Incorporate with SplashKit - API - Input developed functions for handling inputs and
  interactions esp. for window applications
- 2 years: Incorporate with Machine Learning module
- 2.5 years: Data visualisation

## New Scope:

### If dataframes can be salvaged

- Begin ensuring the completed work is there. If not, create cards in Trello for things to be
  re-done.
- Create Objects for data Validation, or remove and rebuild at correct stage in former scope.

### If dataframes can not be salvaged

- Begin the whole module again.
- Estimate new times for completion based on skill level and research.
