## Goals Achieved

Since joining the company and organizing into the appropriate groups for each project, there has
been a sizeable amount of upskilling required to proceed with the project. Upskilling has been
achieved in the use of Trello, the use of GitHub and the use of Confluence, all of which are vital
for project members to successfully deploy self-management, to contribute to the project, and to
design, test and implement the knowledge base solution. There has also been some testing with
Confluence, learning more practically about the functionality and available features of the
technology and how they can be best utilized for the project.

## Difficulties/Issues

Given the unfamiliarity with some of the technologies necessary for this project and for working
within and contributing to Toth Tech, there has been very considerable amounts of necessary
upskilling as mentioned above. This has been a sort of barrier to entry before anything has been
able to be achieved within the group, and as the technology is still relatively new to some members,
progress may at times slow down to accommodate for learning. To combat this issue, members need only
to continue their upskilling as often as possible as they work, keeping what theyâ€™ve learned fresh
in their memories.
