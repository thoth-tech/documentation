# Indigenous Art Gallery

## Documentation Feasibility Check

### Preamble

The purpose of this document is to check the feasibility of documentation within the Indigenous Art
Gallery Project through the use of a knowledge base.

None of the members of this subproject have much familiarity or experience with the platform
"Confluence", so the first main focus will on conducting research on the platform to inform the
choices made in constructing a knowledge base.

### Research Information

Upskilling and research in the use of Confluence has been conducted using online resources, and the
following have been idenitifed as useful sources of instruction and information:

- [The Atlassian Guides:](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/guides/)
- [Software Testing Help Beginnerâ€™s Guide:](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/atlassian-confluence-tutorial/)
- [Confluence Documentation Tutorial 2023:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emn3hoamV-M)
- [Simon Confluence Tutorial for Beginners:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p3QzaS33GA)

### Outcome

After conducting research on Confluence and its capabilities, it appears that the platform wil be
able to house the kind of documentation, code, or guides required for use during and after the
project. The interface itself is simple enough to navigate and will likely be accommodating to newer
users/members given the correct instruction and guidance, which can also be provided by the content
within the knowledge base itself.

### Plan

Further research into the limitations of Confluence (in its free state) need to be carried out to
ensure that none of the restrictions could hinder the use of the knowledge base, especially for use
by the client. If there are limitations in place that cause issue, investigation into circumvention
or minimising harms will be implimented.
