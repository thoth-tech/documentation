# Indigenous Art Gallery

## Dockerization project outline

**Capstone SIT374 - Chloe Hulme**

_Aim_

The aim is to Dockerize the Indigenous Art Gallery Project so that it may run smoothly on every
machine with minimal setup; as well as being able to be deployed into a Docker Swarm.

The first step in this component of the project will be to up-skill on Docker and gain an
understanding of the platform and how it operates. From there, we will formulate a process on how to
Dockerize the project and begin to do so.

_Key Outcomes_

- Feasibility report of product -> Check how this can be achieved and assess possible problems and
  their potential solutions.
- Fully Dockerize front-end to run smoothly in a container.
- Fully Dockerize back-end to run smoothly in a seperate container.

_Delivery Time frames_

The feasibility report and fully Dockerized application will be working and available by the end of
T1 2023.
