# Static Site Generator 


_The purpose of this document is to decide if Gatsby is the most suitable static site generator for our project._

 <br>

Static site are used in cases where you only need to spit out content without the use of back-end frameworks or databases. Use cases could be blog posts, documentations or landing pages. In our case, we are building something similar to a documentation page where we are collecting all the information of Thoth Tech in one single place. I have narrowed down three site generators that could be used for our project 

 
 <br>

 

# 
 <br>

## Gatsby  
<br>

* Gatsby is a site generator based on JavaScript and React 

* Team is more comfortable with JavaScript 

* Gatsby has all the integration and libraries pre packed 

* Option to load pages ahead of time, on demand or server side 

* Used in programming arcana 

<br>


# 
## Jekyll 
<br>

* Jekyll is based on ruby  

* Easiy deployable to github pages 

* Less setup procedure 

* More suited towards blog 

* Easy to maintain 

* Would need to learn bit of ruby to manage this project  

<br>

# 
## Eleventy 

<br>

* Based on node and Javascript 

* Similar to Jekyll 

* Fairly new, so not enough resources available 

* Would need to learn as we go 

 <br>

## Conclusion 
<br> 

It is fair to say that we should pick either gatsby or jekyll. Gatsby gives us more funtionaily but this means will require more effort to maintain. While Jekyll is more like plug and play. Can run site in less than an hour with the templates. So, will have to decide which one to use.
