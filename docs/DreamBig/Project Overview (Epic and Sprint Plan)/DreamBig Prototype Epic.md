# DreamBig Prototype epic

## Background / Context 

DreamBig aims to provide a personalised roadmap integrated with Ontrack to support students to
develop and improve their employability after graduation. In addition, it will provide a platform to
help set realistic expectations for students graduating into the real world.

## Business Value 

DreamBig will be an integrated platform with Ontrack which helps contributing to student
employability. This is important to Thoth Tech as we believe in providing educational resources for
students.

## In Scope 

- User research
- Design Planning & Documentation
- Front-end
- Back-end
- Database
- Security
- Scoping of architecture

## Out of Scope 

- New feature documentation
- Create User documentation

## What needs to happen 

- A lot of research needs to be done around how this will integrate with the existing platform
- Design, how will this look?
- Documentation/Training
- How students are onboarded
- Authentication mechanism (Does it use the same login credential as the university one?)
- Establish QA framework. How will we test?
- Privacy - how will student privacy be protected?
- A protype incorporating all design elements and features

## Assumptions / Dependencies 

There is very little done already due to this being a brand-new project

## UX/UI Considerations 

- Keep it simple, consistent layout
- Similar UI to OnTrack? Brand alignment?

## Analytics Considerations 

How do we want to manage success? What product metrics do we want to measure. For example,
acquisitions of new users.

## Reg & Compliance Considerations 

Security / privacy considerations with student details What kind of testing will be needed to ensure
data will be safe from attacks?

## Operations / Support / Training Considerations 

Documentation needs to be created.

## What are the challenges? 

Designing a product that integrate flawlessly with the existing architecture Creating documentation

## Acceptance criteria 

(Informal)

- Validate documentation with managing directors
- Documentation produced is accurate
