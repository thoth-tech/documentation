![Login process SSO in Dream](Images/login_p

The SSO integration is completed for Dream Big with its architecture illustrated above. Therefore,
both Dream Big and OnTrack can be logged into using your AAF Deakin credentials.

The plan now is to move both of these login systems into a shared architecture to make it easier for
future Thoth Tech projects to have the same login system.

## Shared Module

Please see the
[Thoth Tech Deakin Authentication SSO repository](https://github.com/thoth-tech/deakin-sso-authentication-module)
for where the final external module will be located.

This work has been started and can be found as an outstanding
[pull request](https://github.com/thoth-tech/dream-big/pull/111) in the Dream Big repository for
testing purposes.

This work is outstanding and we have not created a clear plan for the external module. Thus the
above PR is a testing ground. It is imperative to find out the reusable frontend and backend code.
