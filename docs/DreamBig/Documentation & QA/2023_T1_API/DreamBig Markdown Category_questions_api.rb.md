**Requires [Grape Framework](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape#what-is-grape)**

## Code performs the following

1. Retrieval of category questions
2. Creation of category questions
3. Update category questions
4. Delete category questions with indicated ID
5. Get all categorie questions

**Code does not perform validation currently, or anything relatively complex.**

**The category question service is currently partially implemented in the frontend with a created
service, but no data is being sent to the backend. This file is found in
[category_question.service.ts](https://github.com/thoth-tech/dream-big/blob/d72249d788068c71962e5a760ab1e15caef50ce5/dream-big-ui/src/app/services/category_question.service.ts#L16)**

Future updates could include:

- Boolean checks
- More detail about methods
- Bug in delete section, should be 'return true' line 123

### Retrieval of category questions

```ruby
class CategoryQuestionsApi < Grape::API
  desc 'Allow retrieval of an Answer in the Assessment'
  get '/category-questions/:id' do
    # Auth

    question = CategoryQuestion.find(params[:id])
    present question, with: Entities::CategoryQuestionsEntity
  end
```

it is presented to user using CategoryQuestionsEntity class.

### Creation of category questions

```ruby

  params do
    requires :id, type: Integer, desc: 'ID of the Category Question'
    requires :question, type: String, desc: 'question text'
    requires :category_id, type: Integer, desc: 'category ID'
  end
  post '/category-questions' do
    category_questions_parameters = ActionController::Parameters
        .new(params)
        .permit(
          :id,
          :question,
          :category_id
        )

    # Auth...

    created_category_question = CategoryQuestion.create!(category_questions_parameters)

    present created_category_question, with: Entities::CategoryQuestionsEntity
  end
```

This method requires a three parameter:

- id
- description

Used within variable 'created_category_questions' to create an category questions, variable is
presented to user via

          :category_id,
        )
