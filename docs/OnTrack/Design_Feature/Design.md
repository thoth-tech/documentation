## Unit Chair's View:

- Unit chairs can access a new "Content Management" section in the OnTrack dashboard. Within this
  section, unit chairs have options to manage and upload content for their courses.
- Unit chairs can select a course and upload various types of content (documents, presentations,
  videos, etc.).
- An "Upload" button allows them to select files from their local storage.
- Unit chairs can organise content by creating folders or categories for different topics or modules
  like Week 1, Week 2 and so on.
- They can also set access permissions for each content item, determining whether it's visible to
  all students or just them.
- Each content item is displayed with its title and file type.
- Unit chairs can add/edit descriptions for clarity.
- Both unit chairs and students can search for specific content items using keywords or filter
  content by category.
- Unit chairs can update content permissions at any time, controlling who can access specific items.

## Student's View

- Students can access the "Course Resources" section within a specific course on their dashboard.
- In this section, students can see a list of available content items.
- Students can click on a content item to view or download it onto their local device from the
  dropdown as shown in the image above.
- The other download button is to download all the content available at once on their local device.
- If it's a video or document, it opens in a viewer within OnTrack.
- Unit chairs can send notifications to students when new content is uploaded which shows as badges
  in the bell icon.
- Students can see these notifications when they’re logged into their OnTrack accounts.
- Students can only access content that has been made available to them.
