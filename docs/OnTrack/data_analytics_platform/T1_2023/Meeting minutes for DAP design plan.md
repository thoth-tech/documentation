## Discussion Summary

- Different types of graphs were discussed for data analytics platforms to display students'
  progress and assist in improving units and courses.
- The idea of displaying grades of students pursuing distinction and indicating the number of days
  before the deadline for their task submissions was mentioned.
- Early submissions were represented by green dots, while potential difficulties in achieving
  distinction were shown with red dots.
- The ability to select on a dot in the graph to navigate to the student's profile in On Track was
  considered a crucial feature for direct communication and personalized assistance.
- Graphs illustrating the complete distribution of tasks or the entire unit, potentially using a
  bell graph, were proposed.
- However, it was acknowledged that focusing on task status and submission rather than grades might
  be more relevant for On Track's objectives.
- The discussion emphasized the significance of visualizing student progress and providing tools for
  direct engagement between the teaching team and students.
- Three-year statistics were mentioned as a potential resource for identifying trends and informing
  impactful changes to the units.
