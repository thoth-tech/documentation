# Data analytics platform - Something we can use to help better expose data on student and tutor progress to staff

Make sure that the data stay in our control, nothing should be sent to external services, but if
there are other tools we can deploy onsite, then we should look at that and how they get integrated
back into the UI.

Tracking time spent giving feedback by tutor would be a great single addition, if someone wants to
work on that. This would have some design work, back-end work front-end work, and data analytics.
