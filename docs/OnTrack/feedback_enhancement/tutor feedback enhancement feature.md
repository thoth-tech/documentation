## Feature Components

### Models and Definitions

- **TaskDefinition**: This is the core model around which task stages and their corresponding
  feedback are structured. It contains the stages that include criteria for task completion.
- **Stage**: Represents a specific criterion or set of criteria that students must fulfil to
  complete a task. These are detailed in the `TaskDefinition` and include:
  - **id**: Unique identifier for the stage.
  - **taskDefinitionId**: Identifier linking the stage to its task definition.
  - **title**: Descriptive title of the stage.
  - **preamble**: Introductory text providing context or instructions for the stage.
  - **options**: Feedback options associated with each criterion of the stage.

### Example Stage Structure

```typescript
export type Option = [string, string[]];

export type Stage = {
    id: number;
    taskDefinitionId: number;
    title: string;
    preamble: string;
	options: Option[];
}

const stage: Stage = {
    id: 1;
    taskDefinitionId: 1234;
    title: "Source Code: Revised Fly Catch";
    preamble: "**Source Code: Revised Fly Catch**",
    options: [
        ["Use of structs and enumerations",
            ["Effectively utilises structs and enumerations", "Partially addresses use of structs and enums", "Needs improvement in use of structs and enums (Resubmit)", "Does not address use of structs and enums (Redo)"]],
        ["Code Quality",
            ["Well-organised code structure", "Partially organised code structure", "Appropriately commented code", "Insufficient comments", "Lack of comments", "Room for optimisation or clarification"]],
        ["Functionality",
            ["Functionality aligns completely with task requirements", "Functionality mostly aligns with task requirements", "Needs improvement in functionality (Resubmit)", "Functionality not addressed (Redo)"]],
        ["Resubmit",
            ["Resubmit with the required source code", "Resubmit with code that adheres to coding best practices and concepts"]],
    ],
};
```

## Key Components and Files

- **task-definition-stages.component.ts**: Manages the logic for adding, editing, and removing
  stages within a task definition.
- **task-definition-stages.component.html**: Provides the HTML structure for viewing and interacting
  with stages in the UI.
- **task-definition-stages.component.scss**: Contains style definitions specific to the stage
  components in the UI.

## Development Tasks

The development of this feature is divided into several key tasks:

- **UI Design and Implementation**: Designing and implementing user interfaces for adding, editing,
  and viewing stages.
- **Integration**: Integrating the stages model with existing task and comment models to enhance
  feedback mechanisms.
  - **Migration**: One-time data migration script to update all existing task definitions to include
    an empty `stages` array.
- **Documentation and Guides**: Creating comprehensive documentation and user guides for both unit
  chairs and tutors.

## Documentation and User Guides

Documentation is critical for ensuring the effective use of the Tutor Feedback Feature. This
includes:

- **Integration Guides**: Detailed explanations of how the Tutor Feedback Feature integrates with
  existing OnTrack components.
- **User Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for unit chairs and tutors on how to use the feature,
  including how to add, edit, and remove stages, as well as how to provide feedback using the
  system.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

- **Automated Feedback Mechanisms**: Developing algorithms to suggest feedback based on common
  patterns in student submissions.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Enhancing the feature to provide analytics on feedback effectiveness
  and student progress.

This documentation serves as a foundational guide for developing and using the Tutor Feedback
Feature within the OnTrack system, ensuring that all participants have the tools they need to
