"Task component" consists with some subcompoenets which comes together. Although the the  "Task component" has been identified as a one component and mentioned as one in trello board, it needs to be catogerized as follows:

- task-component-composer.coffee
- task-comments-viewer.coffee
- task-definition-selector.coffee
- task-ilo-alignment.coffee
- task-status-selector.coffee
