It works through  the learning outcomes from the tasks which are submitted by students.

This visualization has proper mechanism, but some of the changes can be proposed to enhance this.

So, in the proposed visualization modal, the user provides the following changes:

1. The description boxes should be added to the right hand side of the bar chart and it will help to display the color representations.

2. The description of learning outcomes should be aligned cente.

3. The seperate bars could be displayed for pass tasj range,credit task range, distinction task range and High distiction task range.
