The current model gives the ability to display the error message in a proper manner and  This displays an error message of access permissions and session expiration. 

This modal has a proper mechanism, but some of the changes can be proposed to enhance this.

So, in the proposed modal the user provides the following changes:

1.A description can be added to explain user the error and it should be displayed using a smaller font, and centered.
2.Aback button can be added in the web page and it will help user to get quick action.

New design sketch: Existing UI components are to be used for the input fields and button etc.
