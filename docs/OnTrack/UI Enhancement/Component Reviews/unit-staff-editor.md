## Component outcomes and interactions

The expected outcome from this component is to have the appropriate staff set as convenor or tutor for the selected unit. 
This component will list all staff connected to the selected unit, display their name, role and whether they are the primary convenor or not. 
The user can also remove staff from the unit or search for staff to add to the unit.

## Component migration plan

I plan to unpack the code, function by function to understand each piece. I will then compare against the code for other migrate components and test function by function.
I will create new files and migrate to these new files. I will then test the HTML as I replace the bootstrap components with angular components.
I will then test each function of the component in the new typescript file as I replace the coffeescript file.

## Component review checklist

Next add a checklist similar to: then create a checklist:

[ ] Ability to search for staff [ ] staff can be saved against the unit [ ] role can be assigned and changed for a staff member
