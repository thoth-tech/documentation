## Component outcomes and interactions

Since the component is used globally throughout ontrack the user will be interacting with the component in different parts of the website. Despite being an admin, student or a convenor you will be using the component whenever the user want to upload a file. It enables the user upload different types of file for example docs, pdf, codes, jpeg and many more. If it is not the right file which is uploaded it will result in an error

## Component migration plan

Now for the migration of the componet, we started the migration by creating the replacement files
that are : 
- file-uploader.componet.ts
- file-uploader.componet.html
- file-uploader.component.scss
We will begin migrating the code from angular.js to angular after constructing all the replacement files, according to all the important guidelines and external resources. We may proceed with the migration of the current code because we don't need to alter the component's layout.
