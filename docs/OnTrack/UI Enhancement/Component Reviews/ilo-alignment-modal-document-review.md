The current model gives the ability to enter learning outcomes of assignments, which can be rated through progress buttons as above. This displays how the task is a strong example of this outcome. 

This modal has proper mechanism, but some of the changes can be proposed to enhance this.

So, in the proposed modal the user provides the following changes:

1.Progress bar should be alighned to center of the popup window
2.The assignment name and the learning outcome is displayed through bold letters, not in the colored boxes
3.The rational message should be displayed with proper alignment and font size.

New design sketch: Existing UI components are to be used for the input fields and button etc.
