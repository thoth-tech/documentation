Currently users can see the time out error message when there is no activity with the system for a certain time period. Users should go back and reload.

This modal has proper mechanism ,but some of the changes are propossed to increase the user experience.
In the proposed model , these are the suggested changes;

2. A login button has added to the same page of the session timeout.

New design sketches: Existing UI components are to be used for the input fields and button etc.
