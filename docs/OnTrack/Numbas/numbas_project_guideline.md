## Project guideline – Numbas Integration to Ontrack

## Aim

The aim is to introduce Numbas tests into the Ontrack platform, to ultimately save these results in
the Database.

The first part of the project will be to enable the creation and use of a Numbas test, without
storing the data, then time dependent we will look at enhancing this to saving the data to the
backend and a means to access that information.

## Key Outcomes

- Feasibility report of product – Check how this can be achieved and the potential problems with the
  possible solutions.
- Front end integration to either host or link an existing numbas test for students to complete.
- Back-end configuration to store the numbas test
- Security check of the component

## Delivery Time frames

I will be aiming to have the feasibility report and the Front end integration working to a standard
of production by the end of T1 2023.

We will be aiming for Back end configuration and storing of tests by the end of T2 2023.
