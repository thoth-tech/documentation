## Architectural Goals and Constraints

- Maintaining a base system that supports future work towards developing new or enhancing current
  features that improve the teaching and learning experience.
- front-end components are clear to understand, user friendly, and straightforward to use.
- System allows tutors to upload assessment tasks, resources, and assign learning outcomes to each
  task.
- Students can set a learning outcome goal and filter tasks required for this goal, they can then
  view each task and download the related task resources.
- Through the same task view, students can check deadlines, submit extension requests, send query's
  to tutors, and make task submissions.
- Tutors can view and download submissions, manage extension requests, respond to queries and leave
  feedback.
- System generates progress reports that are sent through email system, users can also track
  progress relating to each unit and their set learning outcome goals.
