# Week 3 To-Do

## Put a plan in place

Week 3 is the right time to reflect on what you're hoping to achieve this trimester, and plan out how you will achieve it.

1. Check out Task 4.1P in OnTrack now and download the template.
	
2. Take the Course Learning Outcomes you included in 1.1P and copy them into this template.
	
3. By the end of next week, you should be able to explain how you're progressing in each of these outcomes, so put a couple of dot points under each CLO indicating what you will be aiming to do to evidence your achievement. 
	
4. Some of those dot points should be contributions you will add to our Company Documentation project, so head over to our [Company Documentation | Trello](https://trello.com/b/FzMlqlWi/company-documentation), use the TASK TEMPLATE card to create a new task, give the contribution a title, fill out the template, assign yourself to the card and finally put it in the TODO or DOING column. 
	
5. Now, get the conversation going. Reply below to let the rest of the team know what you're doing or whether you need some help.
	
6. Don't know where to start or what to do? Let me know
