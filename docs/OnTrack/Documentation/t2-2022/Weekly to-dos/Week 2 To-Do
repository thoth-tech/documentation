# Week 2 To-Do

## Get ready to go
    
Hi Team
Welcome to our first week together! I'm James and I'm leading the Company Documentation team this trimester. Last trimester, Faiq and I worked in a similar team, which also focused on documentation. I can't wait to meet you all. First thing's first:

1. In the Files section of this channel you will find our Team Skill & Availability Matrix 2022 T2.xlsx. Please complete both tabs in full. Especially your availability so I can book our first team meeting at a good time. I'm going to aim for Friday evening so we have some details for our first task.
	
2. Also there is our Workbook 2022 T2 .xlsx. It's not mandatory, but the workbook is a very useful tool to record the tasks and time you put into the unit. I found it invaluable in completing my OnTrack tasks last trimester. Pop your details in the second tab.
	
3. Log in to our team's Trello board, duplicate the Onboarding Starter card, assign yourself to it and start checking off your tasks. Never used Trello before and need a hand? Let me know.

4. Get started on Task 1.1P - it's due on Sunday. To help you complete this, think about what you might like to do this trimester and how you might contribute to Thoth Tech's company documentation, including the thoth-tech/handbook: Thoth Tech Employee Handbook (github.com). Perhaps you have presentation and training skills and can support other project team's in doing their documentation? Maybe you want to lead a team next trimester and you will help me lead this team to develop your leadership skills? Maybe you have documentation experience and you want to add to or improve existing docs? Or perhaps you're fresh to all of this and are aiming to develop your skills ready for the workforce?
	
5. Think of a role title you might like (last semester, we had a few Documentation Developers, the Delivery Lead, and a Business Analyst. We'll talk more about our work, skills, roles and hopes for the trimester at our first meeting.

If you need anything, drop your question in this channel. Either I, or anyone who knows the answer will help you. See you all soon.
