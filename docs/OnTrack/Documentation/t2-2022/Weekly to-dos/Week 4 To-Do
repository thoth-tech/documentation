# Week 4 To-Do

## Start contributing

Now that you've planned out some of your tasks in Trello, start making them happen.

1. Start with a small task to get comfortable with the process of contributing. 
	
2. Check out my regular "Contribution Opportunities" in this channel. These are priority tasks that will attract the attention of leaders and demonstrate a lasting contribution to the company. Reply to any one of them you want to start on.
	
3. Create or update the Trello card for the task (see instructions in Week 3 To-Do)
	
4. In our team meeting, or in this channel, talk about what you're doing. This helps everyone understand what is being focused on and what needs to be picked up.
	
5. Ask for help - we're a helpful team smile
	
6. At the end of this week, you will have one or more OnTrack tasks due depending on what result you are aiming for this semester. My advice is to watch all lectures and read the task sheets and templates carefully so you don't need to resubmit anything.
	
7. Looking for feedback? Drop me an email if you would like to include my reference as part of your evidence.
