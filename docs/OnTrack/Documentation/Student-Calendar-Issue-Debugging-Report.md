## Investigation Summary

**Reported Issue**
Students reported an issue with the calendar feature in the OnTrack Project. The nature of the problem was not clearly defined, requiring an extensive investigation of all calendar functionalities.

**Scope of Testing**
The investigation covered the following areas:

1. Units Management:

2. Reminder Functionality:
    [x] Configured reminders with all available intervals (e.g., 1 week before events).
    [x] Verified that reminders were saved correctly and displayed without errors.

3. Task Start Dates:
    [x] Enabled and disabled the option to include task start dates in the calendar.
    [x] Confirmed that the calendar updated accordingly based on the setting.

4. iCalendar Integration:
    [x] Tested the provided iCalendar subscription link to ensure compatibility with external calendar clients.
    [x] Verified proper synchronization of tasks and events.

5. General Usability:
