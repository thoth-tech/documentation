## How To Use This Template

---

This template has been provided as a way for your team to both log and fix spelling and grammar
errors. These errors are those which you and your team find in documentation that your team is
either responsible for, or which relates to your team. For example, let's say a particular team's
document has an error. The error should be added to that team's version of this template. This way,
the team responsible for the document can be made aware of the error. The team which the document
relates to can then evaluate whether it must be fixed or not.

### How To Create Your New Spelling And Grammar File

---

The following steps outline how this document can be set up for your team.

**NOTE:** As this is a template, when **_{Insert Team Here}_** appears, replace it with your team
name/area. For example, a team named "Critical Issues" or whose area is "Critical Issues" would
replace "**_{Insert Team Here}_**" with "Critical Issues".

1. Create an empty Markdown file in a space your team can access. This should be named something
   like "**_{Insert Team Here}_** Spelling and Grammar Errors."
2. Copy this template into the new file, _starting from the_ "**_{Insert Team Here}_** Spelling and
   Grammar Errors List" _heading below this section._ Information on how to contribute to the
   template is also included below as well.
3. Certain sections below contain the text "**_{Insert Team Here}_**". Ensure these are replaced
   with your team's name and/or section.
4. That's all. You now have a document in which your team can add errors to.

### Further Steps **_ONLY For Teams Working With OnTrack_**

---

For teams **working with OnTrack**, Thoth Tech has a special template for OnTrack Documentation.
This template helps your reader understand your work by concentrating all of the important
information of your document in one place. This allows your reader to get the most important
information out of your documentation as quickly as possible.

To incorporate the OnTrack Documentation Template into your new Spelling and Grammar file, follow
these steps.

1. After copying the below sections of the Spelling and Grammar template into your new file, open
   the
   [OnTrack Documentation Template](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/blob/main/docs/OnTrack/Documentation/OnTrack%20Documentation%20Template.md).
2. Copy the contents of the OnTrack Documentation Template into your new Spelling and Grammar file.
   The contents of the OnTrack Documentation Template should come before (precede) the contents of
   the Spelling and Grammar Template in your new file.
3. Fill out the relevant sections of the OnTrack Documentation Template in your new Spelling and
   Grammar file.
   - Thoth Tech has an
     [OnTrack Documentation Template Guide](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/blob/main/docs/OnTrack/Documentation/OnTrack-Documentation-Template-Guide.md),
     which explains how to do this. It also explains in more detail why the template is used, and
     contains some links on writing documentation for Thoth Tech.

# **_{Insert Team Here}_** Spelling and Grammar Errors List

## Document Purpose

---

The purpose of this document is to form a list wherein spelling and grammar issues in current
**_{Insert Team Here}_** documentation can be identified. They can then be subsequently assessed,
and if need be, fixed.

Fixing these spelling and grammar mistakes increases the effectiveness and efficiency of the
documentation in question. This erases the potential for confusion as a result of any erroneous
words or phrases.

## Data Required For Each Entry

---

The following data points are recorded for each entry:

- Document Name
  - The document name allows the reader to understand in which file you have found an error, or
    something that must be checked over.
- Document File Path (in GitHub)
  - Most all of Thoth Tech's documentation can be found in it's GitHub repositories. Including the
    document file path helps the reader find the document quickly, instead of searching through all
    of Thoth Tech's GitHub repositories for it. The reader could instead follow this file path to
    identify where the document is that you are referring to. For example, the file path of the
    OnTrack Documentation is: _documentation/docs/OnTrack/Documentation_.
- Erroneous Words/Phrases
  - Listing the erroneous words or phrases your entry refers to informs the reader as to where the
    problems are in the document.
- Corrective Suggestions
  - Listing these indicates to your reader why you think the mentioned words and/or phrases must be
    changed. They can then take these suggestions into consideration when proofreading the document.

## How This Document Is Formatted:

---

Entries into this document are made through the use of tables written in Markdown. The table appears
as shown below:

| Document Name | Document File Path (in GitHub) | Erroneous Words/Phrases             | Corrective Suggestions                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Example-1"   | documents/Example-1            | "...their is a document called..."  | In this context, "there" should be used instead of "their". |
| "Example-2"   | documents/Example-2            | "... When's the meeting today> ..." | ">" should be replaced with "?".                            |

For further information on Markdown, what it is and how to use it, Thoth Tech has a
[Markdown Guide](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/learning/training/markdown-guide.md).

### Adding A New Entry

---

To add an entry to an existing table, each bit of data you enter should be separated by a '|'. For
example, the first entry of the above table, in Markdown, is therefore written like this:

> | "Example-1" | documents/Example-1 | "...their is a document called..." | In this context,
> "there" should be used instead of "their". |

As you can see, each column's data in the entry is separated by a "|". A "|" is also needed on each
end of the table as well. In the above example, this is before "Example-1" and after "Meeting is
spelt incorrectly".

### Important Considerations When **_Making New Additions_** To This Document

---

- To save readers having to go in between many different files when looking through this list,
  _order entries by document_.
- Tables written in Markdown do not allow dot points in their data. Therefore, if more than one
  corrective suggestion is written, these must be numbered to help the reader differentiate them.
  For example: 1. First suggestion. 2. Second suggestion.
- Where corrective suggestions are small changes, for example, the changing of one letter/character,
  highlighting the changes in your suggestions may better help readers understand them. This can be
  done through the use of italics or bold text.
  - _Italics_ can be written by including one asterisk ("\*") on either side of the text you wish to
    be in italics.
  - **Bold** text can be written by including two asterisks ("\*\*") on either side of the text you
    wish to be in bold.
- Ensure entries are written so that any reader, regardless of their level of contextual knowledge,
  could understand what your suggestions mean.
- Thoth Tech uses a **set of rules** when **writing documentation**. The
  [Writing Style Guide](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/processes/documentation/writing-style-guide.md)
  outlines these.
- Thoth Tech also uses the tools "Prettier" and "Vale" for **writing documentation**. Thoth Tech has
  an
  [Installation Guide](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/learning/useful-resources/setup-prettier-and-vale.md)
  for both of these technologies.

### Important Considerations When **_Fixing Items_** In This List:

---

- If you are not a member of the team to which this list belongs to, ensure you have their
  permission **_before_** editing documentation.
  - You may not understand their workings and could hinder their progress if you make unannounced
    and/or unverified changes. Changing their work without their knowledge could have unforeseen
    consequences.
  - What you perceive as spelling and/or grammar errors in a document may be correct in the context
    of that document. It would be beneficial to ask whether something is an error, instead of
    assuming it is and editing the document.
- Once an error is fixed and verified as correct, delete it from this list.

### List of Known Instances:

| Document Name | Document File Path (in GitHub) | Erroneous Words/Phrases | Corrective Suggestions |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Document 1    | File Path                      | Words and Phrases       | Suggestions            |
