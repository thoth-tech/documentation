# OnTrack Documentation Template Guide

## Purpose of this Guide

---

The purpose of this guide is to explain how to properly use the
[OnTrack Documentation Template](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/blob/main/docs/OnTrack/Documentation/OnTrack%20Documentation%20Template.md).

Documentation is all about informing others. By using the documentation template, you will be able
to provide all the information needed for others to understand your work. This guide will show you
why each line of data in the template is included. That way, you can better understand the template
in general.

Let's get started!

## The Sections of the Template

---

There are seven sections to the template:

- Author Information
- Document Summary
- Document Review Information
- Key Terms
- Key Links/Resources
- Contacts for further information
- Related Documents

Each of these sections have been included because they give your reader important information about
your documentation. Therefore, having this important information at the very start of your
documentation will help the reader to better understand what you have to say.

Let's look at each section more closely.

### Author Information

---

The Author Information section is all about the author, or authors, of the documentation. When
reading something that has been written, it's often very helpful to know who wrote it. That way, if
the reader has more questions about it, or has some suggestions on the documentation itself, they
know who to talk to.

This section contains the following information:

- Author(s)
- Team
- Team (Delivery and/or Product) Lead

An **Author**, or **Authors** when there is more than one, should be included to let the reader know
who wrote the document. This also gives the reader someone to contact about the documentation if
they need/want more information. Conversely, they can contact the author if the document ever needs
to be edited, altered or updated.

The **Team** responsible for the document should also be included. This informs the reader about
which team/project the document relates to. Hence, it would also give the reader more understanding
about how the documentation relates to the company as a whole.

The **Team (Delivery and/or Product) Lead** should be listed. This gives the reader an understanding
of who is responsible for the team that the documentation relates to. Similar to the **authors**,
this gives the reader a second point of contact. They could be contacted to get more information on
the topic, or if the document needs to be edited, altered or updated.

### Document Summary

---

The Document Summary section contains information about the content of the document. In other words,
it's all about what the documentation is trying to inform the reader about. In this section, the
reader will be able to understand the general purpose of your documentation, and what it is about.

This section contains the following information:

- Documentation Title
- Documentation Type
- Documentation Information Summary

A **Documentation Title** should be included within any documentation to let readers know what the
document is about. Similar to the title of a book, this will let readers know what the information
contained within relates to.

The **Documentation Type** denotes to the reader what type of documentation your document is. An
**Informative** document would explain a topic to your reader, similar to this guide. A
**Technical** document however, would require or assume in-depth knowledge of the documentation's
subject. This might be used for explaining specific pieces of code.

Lastly, the **Documentation Information Summary** section is included to give the reader a general
understanding of the document itself. Here, you can write some text about what information is
contained within the document. This gives the reader more of an idea of what your document is about
before they start reading, helping them to better understand.

In the template, using this guide as an example, this section could look like this:

- **Documentation Title**: OnTrack Documentation Template Guide
- **Documentation Type**: Informative
- **Documentation Information Summary**:
  - This document outlines how to use the OnTrack Documentation Template. It explains each data
    point and each section of the template, giving readers a better understanding of how to utilise
    the template.

### Document Review Information

---

This section of the template is included to inform your reader about how up-to-date a document is.
Any documentation, regardless of what it is about, should always be as up-to-date as possible. This
ensures the information your document conveys to the reader is useful and understandable to them.

This section contains the following information:

- Date of Original Document Submission to GitHub
- Documentation Version
- Date of Previous Documentation Review
- Date of Next Documentation Review

All documentation for Thoth Tech is housed within an online website called GitHub. Thoth Tech has
numerous file structures in GitHub to which documents are uploaded to. The **Date of Original
Document Submission to GitHub** should therefore be supplied. This gives the reader an understanding
of when the document was first uploaded to GitHub. This knowledge will inform the reader of how old
the document is, regardless of how many versions or iterations there are.

A **Documentation Version** (i.e. Version 1.0 or V1.0) should also be included where there have been
multiple versions or iterations of a particular document. A Version Number would help readers in
working out which version of the documentation they are reading. This could come in handy if the
reader needed to review a long-ago written (legacy) version, or if two versions needed to be
compared.

The **Date of Previous Documentation Review** should be included to show when the last review of the
document was done. This would inform readers as to how long ago the documentation was last confirmed
as up-to-date. Therefore, the reader gains a better understanding of whether the information is
still current.

A **Date of Next Documentation Review** should be included to give readers the date when the
document will/could/should next be reviewed. This could be recorded either by the author(s), or an
authorised company member. Including this data ensures that the document can be reviewed
periodically to ensure continuing accuracy. Depending on how often the data in the document may
change or become obsolete, this could be altered.

An example could look like this:

- **Date of Original Document Submission to GitHub**: 23rd March 2023
- **Documentation Version**: v1.0
- **Date of Previous Documentation Review**: N/A (first version)
- **Date of Next Documentation Review**: 1st June 2023

### Key Terms

---

A **Key Terms** section could be included within your document to give the definitions of terms or
phrases important to your documentation. This list could provide your reader with the background
knowledge they need to gain the best understanding of what you are trying to say. This might be
particularly helpful in technical documents, where a number of terms might need to be defined.

### Key Links/Resources

---

Similarly, a list of **Key Links or Resources** could also help your reader in understanding your
documentation better. In this section you could include hyperlinks to webpages or even other Thoth
Tech documents in GitHub to give your reader necessary background information. Having these links at
the start of your documentation also saves the reader looking for them throughout the entire
document. With this background information and links, this list will assist your reader in
understanding what you have to say.

### Contacts for further information

---

Including a list of **Contacts for further information** could be beneficial to your reader. This
list would include people who can be contacted if the reader would like more information about:

- your documentation
- the information within your documentation
- the subject of your documentation.

Given Thoth Tech's teams come and go each trimester, it might be a good idea to list more constant
contacts, like Deakin staff. Listing staff, or other company members not within the Capstone
unit(s), would ensure new teams have a point of contact for more information each trimester. The
list of contacts would ensure the new teams have an idea of who would best help them understand your
documentation. Also, it shows the most suitable people they can ask questions to regarding the
document.

### Related Documents

---

Listing **Related Documents** to your documentation could also help the reader better understand
what you are trying to say. This section could list other documents that might aid the reader in
understanding your work. This could include documents that:

- are related to the subject of your documentation
- would provide the reader with necessary background information
- could otherwise help your reader in understanding your document.

For example, the beginning of this guide contains a link to the Documentation template, as it
relates to this document. Supplying a link to the template itself will aid readers with
understanding this guide.
