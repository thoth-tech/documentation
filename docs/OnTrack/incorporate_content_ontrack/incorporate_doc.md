- Design the overview of the front-end interface.
- Make adjustment to API, to ensure that the response is accurate.
- Create a test case for front end that upheld the user experience of the feature.

## UML Diagram

- Create a UML diagram that will show the flow of incorporating content on Ontrack and the flow
  during the process.
- How it will interact with front end, backend as well as with other features that are already in
  place.

## Coding

- Code the new feature, that will allow unit chairs to host content and make it accessible for
  students to view.
