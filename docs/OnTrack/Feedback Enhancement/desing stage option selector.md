### Tutors' View

- Tutors can access a new "Stage Selection" modal when adding comments in the OnTrack dashboard.
- Within this modal, tutors have options to select relevant feedback stages for students.
- Tutors can select multiple stages such as "Use of Structs and Enumerations," "Code Quality,"
  "Functionality," "Discuss," and "Resubmit." (Example only, stages are input by the unit chair when
  creating the task).
- Each stage is displayed with a checkbox, allowing tutors to select one or multiple stages.
- Tutors can submit their selections, which will be included in the student's feedback.
