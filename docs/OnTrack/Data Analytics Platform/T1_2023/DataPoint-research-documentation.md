more effectively.

## Current Scope

The aims of this research and its concurrent documentation are as follows:

1. Gain a better understanding of what an The Data Analytcis Platform needs to do for tutors to
   provide a better experience for both parties;
2. Devise Algorithms for the Platform;
3. Gain better insight into what can be built and what not, come up with a rational and ethical
   solution;
4. Design the Platform to analyse only validated and required data points;
5. Identified the required changes in Database for Ontrack to later accomodate the platform within
   it;
