- Documentation Title: Audio System Interface Design Document
- Documentation Type: Technical
- Documentation Information Summary: Design document detailing the implementation of the OnTrack
  Voice Verification audio system interface, showcased by wire frames for frontend development.
  Interface to allow tutors to see the results from the voice verification test with the new OnTrack

## Low Fidelity Designs

**Figure 1** below shows the initial sketches and brainstorming put into place for the tutors
interface when accessing the voice verification results.

**Figure 2** below shows a digital draft design for the flowchart between the three different
results and visualisations shown in Figure 1. The visualisations are shown for the results and
similar conventions used for display. Branching off to the main processes that would subsequently
become an output from clicking on these results.

**Figures 3 and 4** below shows the process and results when the tutor clicks on an audio file.
These figures show files that are still pending.

**Figures 5 and 6** below shows the process and results of when the tutor clicks on an verification
pending audio file.
