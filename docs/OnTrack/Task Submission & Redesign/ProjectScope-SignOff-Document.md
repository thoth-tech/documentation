## Deliverables Verification for T1 2023

The following items will be completed to verify that the project scope has been met:

### Purely Documentation Oriented

- [x] Modify the project epic and other related documents (make it relevant to T1/2023).

  - A modification to a markdown document in
    [thoth-tech/documentation](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/tree/main/docs/OnTrack/Task%20Submission%20%26%20Redesign).

- [x] Update the document that outlines the deliverable items of the project.

  - A markdown document in
    [thoth-tech/documentation](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/tree/main/docs/OnTrack/Task%20Submission%20%26%20Redesign).

- [x] Create a T1/2023 hand-over document.
  - A markdown document in
    [thoth-tech/documentation](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/tree/main/docs/OnTrack/Task%20Submission%20%26%20Redesign).

### Front-end Oriented

#### Design

- [x] Create frame-by-frame flows of tutors using the primary design.

  - Multiple images and a video showcase, as output from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), in
    [thoth-tech/documentation](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/tree/main/docs/OnTrack/Task%20Submission%20%26%20Redesign/design_images),

  - Additional information: These flows should determine whether an alteration to the single,
    primary design is required and what specific alteration is required. This could be broken down
    into tasks regarding specific flows for showing the use of specific features.

- [x] Create `TaskSubmissionEnhancement` new Features to the student-view design.

  - Multiple images and a video showcase in
    [thoth-tech/documentation](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/tree/main/docs/OnTrack/Task%20Submission%20%26%20Redesign/design_images),
    as output from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

  - A markdown document that explains the functions and implementation of the new features in
    [thoth-tech/documentation](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/tree/main/docs/OnTrack/Task%20Submission%20%26%20Redesign).

### Back-end Oriented

#### `TaskSubmissionEnhancement`

- [x] Create a prototype of `TaskSubmissionEnhancement` Component of the Ontrack platform that adds:
