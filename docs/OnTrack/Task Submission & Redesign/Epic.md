UX: User Experience; all aspects of the end-user's interactions with an application or device.

Flow: A frame-by-frame image of a user (a student, tutor, convenor, or administrator) performing a

# View Task and Submission Epic Document

## Background / Context

OnTrack is employed by multiple institutions as a learning management system. The View Task and
Submission project intends to create user-centric modifications to existing features, addition of
new features to the task submission and view in the OnTrack platform.

## Business Value

By further modernising OnTrack, institutions can deploy the OnTrack platform to satisfy the needs of
their students, markers, assessors, and auditors. The platform can support all stakeholders to
fulfil their obligations and, in the case of the student, support the learning of essential
concepts. By streamlining the experience of markers, then associated costs may decrease.
Additionally, the feedback loop for students (the learning feedback loop) may shorten.

## In Scope

- Design planning and documentation
- Removal of redundant features
- Modification of existing features
- Addition of new features
- Task view for students
- Task submission for students
- Task view for markers
- Front-end
- Back-end
- Security
- Database

## Out of Scope

- Visual flavour
- Logo

## UI/UX Considerations

- Navigability
  - Can all features be navigated to?
    - New features?
    - Previous features that were retained?
  - Navigability can be gauged by the creation of multiple flows.
- Accessibility

## Regulation & Compliance Considerations

- Storage and privacy of user's data.
- Security
- Retention policy.

## Operations / Support / Training Considerations

Team members may require training/up-skilling in applications, technologies, and languages, such as:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/),
- [Figma](https://figma.com/),
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/),
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/),
- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/),
- [Python](https://www.python.org/),
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/),
- [Angular](https://angular.io/),
- [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com/),
- [React](https://reactjs.org/),
- [MUI](https://mui.com/).

Team members must express testing skills by use of various testing tools to ensure functionalities
work as intended. They also must be able to fix and/or document and report on issues or bugs as they
arise.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Managing director must approve of the design before implementation.
- If a change is required, then an alteration to the design (with approval from the managing
  director) must be completed first.
- All code must be tested before an attempt to pull into the upstream repositories.
