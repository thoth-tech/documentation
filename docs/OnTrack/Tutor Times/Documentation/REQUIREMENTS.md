# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the frontend development of the
"Tutor Times" feature. This feature will enable tutors to track and manage the time spent on
providing feedback to students.

## 1.2 Scope

The scope of this document covers the functional and non-functional requirements for the frontend
implementation of the "Tutor Times" feature.

## 1.3 Intended Audience

This document is intended for frontend developers and the development team responsible for
implementing the "Tutor Times" feature.

# 2. Functional Requirements

## 2.1 Tutor's Marking Progress Page

- Create a dedicated page/dashboard where tutors can view their marking progress.
- Display the time spent providing feedback to each student.

## 2.2 User Interface

- Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the Tutor's Marking Progress Page.
- Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes and devices.
- Provide an option for tutors to manually input marking time.

## 2.3 Timer/Stopwatch Feature

- Implement a timer or stopwatch feature that tutors can start and stop to track time spent on each
  student.
- Ensure accuracy in time tracking.

## 2.4 Manual Time Input

- Allow tutors to manually input marking time for each student in case they forget to start or stop
  the timer.

## 2.5 Notification System

- Implement a notification system to alert tutors when they reach specific time milestones.

# 3. Non-Functional Requirements

## 3.1 Performance

- Ensure that the Tutor's Marking Progress Page loads quickly.
- Minimize any performance impact on the overall application.

## 3.2 Usability

- The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use for tutors.
- Ensure that the feature is accessible to all users.

## 3.3 Compatibility

- Ensure compatibility with modern web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Verify cross-browser compatibility and address any compatibility issues.

## 3.4 Security

- Implement necessary security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to
  marking time records.

# 4. User Stories

## 4.1 User Story 1

**As a tutor, I want to see how long I have spent providing feedback to each student.**

- Tutors should be able to view the time spent on each student's feedback on the Tutor's Marking
  Progress Page.

## 4.2 User Story 2

**As a unit chair, I want to see how long each tutor has spent providing feedback to each student.**

- Unit chairs should have access to view the total marking time for each tutor on the Tutor's
  Marking Progress Page.

## 4.3 User Story 3

**As a unit chair, I want to see how long each tutor has spent providing feedback to each task.**

- Unit chairs should be able to see the time spent by each tutor on specific tasks on the Tutor's
  Marking Progress Page.

# 5. Design Mockups

- Link will be provided to the design mockups for the Tutor's Marking Progress Page.

# 6. Testing Requirements

## 6.1 Unit Testing

- Develop unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of frontend components, including
  timers, manual input, and notifications.

## 6.2 User Acceptance Testing

- Conduct user acceptance testing to verify that the "Tutor Times" feature meets the requirements
  and user expectations.
