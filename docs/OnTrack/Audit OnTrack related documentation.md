**Audit OnTrack related documentation ![ref1]**

**Introduction** 

This document is a detailed guide for organizing and categorizing important files in the Thoth Tech OnTrack repository. It explains where each file should go based on its purpose, audience, and relevance, making it easier for both developers and users to find what they need. The guide only covers content from the OnTrack repository and clearly states whether files should stay in OnTrack or be moved to the Doubtfire Astro repository. This organized approach improves usability, supports better collaboration, and ensures the documentation is tailored to its audience. 

**Repository Overview** 

**Thoth Tech OnTrack Repository** 

**Target Audience:** Internal development teams, new students, QA teams, and project contributors. 

**Purpose:** Focuses on internal software development, system architecture, QA testing strategies, and feature documentation for OnTrack. 

**Content Examples:** Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), test cases, UML designs, and UI enhancement guides. 

**Doubtfire Astro Repository** 

**Target Audience:** End-users, deployment teams, and external stakeholders. 

**Purpose:** Provides user-facing deployment documentation, API guides, and other resources to facilitate end-user interaction with the Doubtfire Astro platform. 

**Content Examples:** Deployment instructions, feature lists for end-users, and user onboarding materials. 

**Purpose and Structure of Documentation** 

This plan ensures that all files are appropriately categorized and relocated to their intended repositories for optimized usage. The files are divided based on their relevance to development, QA, or end-user needs. By maintaining clear organization, this document simplifies the onboarding process for new developers, enhances team collaboration, and ensures seamless knowledge transfer. 

**Key Points of the Documentation Plan** 

**Developer-Focused Documentation (Thoth Tech OnTrack):** 

Includes files for software design, testing, and backend/frontend setup. Examples: 

- Prototype SRS.md (internal requirements) ![ref1]
- UML Design.md (system diagrams) 
- Test-Strategy.md (QA testing plans) 

**End-User-Focused Documentation (Doubtfire Astro):** Covers deployment guides and user instructions. Examples: 

- Doubtfire-Deployment.md (deployment steps for users) 

**Plan for Documentation Allocation**
