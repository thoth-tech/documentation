## Workflow Summary

**Step 1.** Set up for new feature branch:

````shell
git checkout development                # make sure you are on develop
git pull --rebase upstream development  # sync your local develop with upstream's develop
git fetch thoth
git checkout -b my-new-branch           # create your new feature branch```
````

**Step 2.** Make changes, and repeat until you are done:

````shell
git add ...
git commit
git push     # make changes, commit, and push to origin```
````

**Step 3.** Submit a pull request and if unable to merge:

```shell
git pull --ff upstream development # merge upstream's develop in your feature branch
git add ...
git commit           # resolve merge conflicts and commit
git push origin                    # push your merge conflict resolution to origin
```
