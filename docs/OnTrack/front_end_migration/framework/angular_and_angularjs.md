# Different between Angular and AngularJS

## Definition

**AngularJS** is an open-source, JavaScript-based, front-end web application framework for dynamic
web app development. It utilizes HTML as a template language. By extending HTML attributes with
directives and binding data to HTML with expressions, AngularJS creates an environment that is
readable, extraordinarily expressive, and quick to develop.

**Angular 2** is the blanket term used to refer to Angular 2, Angular 4 and all other versions that
come after AngularJS. Both Angular 2 and 4 are open-source, TypeScript-based front-end web
application platforms.

**Angular 4** is the latest version of Angular. Although Angular 2 was a complete rewrite of
AngularJS, there are no major differences between Angular 2 and Angular 4. Angular 4 is only an
improvement and is backward compatible with Angular 2.

## Angular JS vs Angular

Angular uses TypeScript and has components as its main building blocks. It is component-based,
whereas AngularJS uses directives.

Angular's operation employs a hierarchy of components, while AngularJS has directives that allow
code reusability. So, The AngularJS framework provides reusable components for its users.

**Why Angular?**

- It has a mobile support framework.
- The latest Angular version supports TypeScript and enables code optimization and modularity by
  employing the OOPS concept.
- It supports the changes for an increased hierarchical dependencies system.
- A developer can use various features such as syntax for type checking, Dart, TypeScript, ES5,
  iterators, Angular CLI, ES6, and lambda operators.
- Angular opts for semantic versioning that has a major-minor-patch arrangement.
- Amongst its best benefits is its provision for the event of simplest routing.

**Why AngularJS?**

- It's secure MVC (Model-View-Controller) data binding makes application performance dynamic.
- A developer can easily perform unit testing or change detection at any point.
- It provides several helpful features for web developers, like declarative template language with
  HTML to allow them to make it more intuitive.
- The open-source framework allows well-structured front-end development. It doesn't require any
  plugin or other platforms to work.
- The AngularJS application runs on Android and iOS phones and tablets.
