## Tasks undertaken

List key tasks likely to help another developer

- Engaged in Discussion with Andrew Cain
- Created a Trello backlog for the continued development of Data Analytics

## What we found out

The Data Analytics feature as it currently exists in OnTrack provides a limited set of
visualisations given the data available. The current visualisations are: Target Grade Pie Chart,
Task Status Pie Chart & Task Completion Box Plot. For the future development of Data Analytics,
although integrated visualisations will continue to play a key role in providing a quick overview of
the data, the ability to export the data to a third party tool such as Tableau or PowerBI will be a
key feature. This will allow for more complex visualisations to be created and for the data to be
analysed in more depth. The current visualisations will need to be migrated to the latest version of
Angular and maintained as they provide a quick overview of the data. One particular area where the
current visualisations are lacking is the ability to track interaction time such as tutor time to
provide task feedback, this is a key visualisation which could be added to the existing
visualisations. In parallel to extending the current visualisations, the requirements of the export
feature will be investigated including a questionnaire to understand the needs of Unit chairs and
tutors, before designing UML diagrams and implementing the feature.
