# Deployment Epic

**Background**

A live implementation of the OnTrack platform is accessible through Deakin University and other
organisations around the world. Currently, there is no separately hosted platform for Thoth Tech's
code implementation to operate on.

**Business Value**

Now that Thoth Tech has been established and development work on OnTrack will start to increase,
we need a Thoth Tech hosted deployment of OnTrack. This will provide greater freedom to develop
OnTrack to the evolving vision of the company.

**In scope:**

- Thoth Tech Ontrack deployment to Google Cloud
- Documentation of deployment
- CI/CD Pipeline
- Documentation of pipeline
- Authentication
- Documentation of authentication

**Out of scope**

New features

**What needs to happen** :

The deployment team will need to create an employee-run/hosted version of OnTrack to Google
Cloud, which will be separate to the Deakin version. This will be completed by three teams, which
will all be working together to migrate to google cloud, build a CI/CD pipeline, and create the
authentication for the platform for students.

- Thoth Tech Ontrack deployment to Google Cloud
- CI/CD Pipeline built
- Add LDAP server option
- Extend API with user management
- Provide password management for LDAP and database implementations.

**Assumptions / Dependencies**

- All functions will be working when OnTrack is migrated to student version
- The deployment won’t create any additional security risks

**Analytics Considerations**

N/A

**Reg & Compliance Considerations**

- Storage and privacy of user’s data
- Security
- Retention policy


**Operations/Support**

Team members may need training/upskilling in technologies such as Google Cloud, Ruby on Rails,
Docker, etc. Members will also need testing skills to make sure all the new functionality works and to
be able to fix any bugs/problems.

**What are the challenges?**

Team members have no existing code to work off, as this is new project that is being implemented
however they may be able to use the OnTrack deployment architecture as a guide. Team members
may have also not had the opportunity to work with the technologies they will be using for the
deployment of OnTrack to Google Cloud.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Validate architecture and planning documentation with leadership
- CI/CD pipeline has testing, linting and security built into it
- Documentation is accurate to current version of products
- Thoth Tech deployment is successfully hosted on Google Cloud and functions as expected
- Allow for admins to change passwords (but cannot access passwords)
