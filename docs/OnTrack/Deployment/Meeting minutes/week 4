# Main motions

- Demo documentation (https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/ThothTech2-
    Deployment/Shared%20Documents/Deployment/Documentation/demo%20doc.docx?d=we
    ac1113a086c40aeaaec95ba7a4115be&csf=1&web=1&e=KxDKBz)

```
I have created three documentation word docs for the deployment team to work on. This
can be found in files, in the deployment channel. Within the “documentation” folder, there
is a “demo doc”, which is just a quick rundown/example of what the group members will
need to fill in for their documentation.
```
- Continue to work on the Trello board and further break down the tasks. Also divide up the
    work between group members in the Trello board, add your name to what tasks you will be
    working on. Also add iterations to each task.

## An example of this is 1.1 – upskilling with GitHub, 1.2 – upskilling with ruby on rails,

## 2.1 setup for the technologies you will be using, 3.1 implementing a certain

## feature, etc.

- Please use the deployment channel more for communication. You might have a question
    that someone else wants to know, it also shows evidence of contribution, as that is a space
    where leaders and tutors can see you actively contributing, and they can’t see your private
    chats.
- How is everyone going with their deliverables? (Please remember to document everything
    you’re doing in the documentation file). If you haven’t started, please start. This doesn’t
    mean you’ll be doing any programming, but a start might include upskilling, as learning the
    technology you’ll be using is an essential part to being able to achieve the end goal of the
    deliverable
- **For google cloud group –** I’ll be booking in a time with Andrew sometime this week to get a
    better understanding of the google cloud service (e.g., if there will be a fee to use google
    cloud or if it is free) _(Andrew has a bunch of credit that he wants us to use for Google Cloud_
    _and is willing to put toward this unit – hence why he chose that service)_


- for anyone that is still yet to fill out the skills matrix and availability, please do so ASAP
- if you have any questions, please contact me though the **deployment** channel, as you may
    ask a question another person is wanting to know, and it is hard for me to keep up with
    private messages
