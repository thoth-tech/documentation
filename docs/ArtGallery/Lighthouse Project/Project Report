**DDGIT Website**

Our first task, we will need to locate or document website site map, create an excel file that we can use to document our findings for each page. We will need comparisons for how it is is displaying in different web browsers and devices. We can collaborate on this excel file in Teams but less work if we can add it to GitHub and then our contributions will be tracked as was mentioned in class today.
