### Goals/Objectives

1\. Analyse website with Google lighthouse to identify areas of improvement First round of reports
complete pending upload to GitHub

2\. Identify other front end testing tools that could be used in addition to Lighthouse

2\. Compile Report outlining findings and action points derived from this Commenced Reporting
document for presentation

3\. Timeline for implementing actions Action - SiteMap being built by Adrienne Gelbhauer Action -
Add Lang-en to site pages Action - Optimise images and set instructions (possibly supply to
documentation team)

4\. Implement Improvements

5\. What is Outstanding - Handover Tasks in GitHub/Trello Possibly good to implement this in future
requires further research converting lighthouse report into workflow actions
<https://blog.logrocket.com/lighthouse-meets-github-actions-use-lighthouse-ci/>

This will achieve the following deliverables:

Cleaner platform, minimising errors (technical and cosmetic), improving overall look and feel of
website increasing companies brand.

### DDGIT Website

Our first task, we will need to locate or document website site map, create a file that we can use
to document our findings for each page. We will need comparisons for how it is displaying in
different web browsers and devices. We can collaborate on this excel file in Teams but less work if
we can add it to GitHub and then our contributions will be tracked as was mentioned in class today.

### Project Status - 30 March 2023

We have created our first round of Lighthouse Reports and need to submit to GitHub We have noted
some enhancements for the front-end and improvements for the back-end using our reports and industry
knowledge. We have touched base with our client to confirm our direction and progress. Our team is
moving forward with work on Analysing the report and identifing how these can be implemented in
Thoth - Art Gallery. These improvements are primarily surrounding naming conventions, optimisation,
image scaling, creation of a site-map.
