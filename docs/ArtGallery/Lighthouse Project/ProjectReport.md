Objectives for Semester 1 2023

### Goals/Objectives

1\. Analyse website with Google lighthouse to identify areas of improvement
First round of reports complete pending upload to GitHub - Added to GitHub 4 April 2023

2\. Identify other front end testing tools that could be used in addition to Lighthouse

2\. Compile Report outlining findings and action points derived from this
Commenced Reporting document for presentation

3\. Timeline for implementing actions
Action - SiteMap being built by Adrienne Gelbhauer
Action - Add Lang-en to site pages
Action - Optimise images and set instructions (possibly supply to documentation team)

4\. Implement Improvements

5\. What is Outstanding - Handover Tasks in GitHub/Trello
Possibly good to implement this in future requires further research converting lighthouse report into workflow actions

This will achieve the following deliverables:

Cleaner platform, minimising errors (technical and cosmetic), improving overall look and feel of website increasing companies brand.

### DDGIT Website

Our first task, we will need to locate or document website site map, create a file that we can use to document our findings for each page. We will need comparisons for how it is is displaying in different web browsers and devices. We can collaborate on this excel file in Teams but less work if we can add it to GitHub and then our contributions will be tracked as was mentioned in class today.

### Project Status - 30 March 2023

We have created our first round of Lighthouse Reports and need to submit to GitHub
We have noted some enhancements for the front-end and improvements for the back-end using our reports and industry knowledge. We have touched base with our client to confirm our direction and progress. Our team is moving forward with work on Analysing the report and identifing how these can be implemented in Thoth - Art Gallery. These improvements are primarily surrounding naming conventions, optimisation, image scaling, creation of a site-map.

GitHub (first steps created by Chloee Hulme)

Fork repo in GUI (only needs to be done once per repo at the start) -> then clone forked repo into a local directory:

git clone <[http:// etc... the link from the repo](http://%20etc...%20the%20link%20from%20the%20repo)>


**Creating a new branch (by Chloee Hulme):**

git checkout -b <topic>/<branch description>

*Using 'checkout' will automatically switch you onto this branch*

**After making your changes:**

git add .

git commit ------>> press 'i' key to edit then: <topic>:<message>, hit esc, then type :wq and hit enter

git push -u origin <your new branch name>


**Creating a draft pull request:**

Go into GUI and create a draft pull request (pull request will be between Thoth Techs file vs your repo's file, ie. Thoth tech/Art Gallery/README.md vs My Forked Repo/Art Gallery/README.md), add in a relevant comment, then mark it as ready for review.

**Lighthouse Action Points**
1\. SiteMap
2\. Lang-en to page headers (<html> element does not have a [lang] attribute)
3\. Rollover actions
4\. Optimise Images (plus width/height and alt tags)
5\. Naming convention for Link names (Links do not have a discernible name)
6\. Document Meta details (Document does not have a meta description)
7\. CSS Action Items (meta theme, start_url, splash screen)
8\. Apple-Touch-Icon

**SEO Considerations**
