#### Handover notes Art Gallery testing team

**Front End Testing**

Front end testing guide is listed in the documentation for both the E2E and unit tests. There are
some issues with the login unit test not working correctly that need to be fixed.

The E2E testing is complete, but if you were looking for additional things to test you could focus
on testing some of the features after the user is logged in. e.g. adding an exhibition to the table.

Back End Testing

Back end testing is not working correctly for 20% of the tests it is running. I would be good to
repair this and document further as required.

#### Additional notes

There has been a discussion around changing the technology stack for the Art-Gallery Project over to
Angular with a Maria Database for performance. If this was to occur the tests would need to be
reviewed and ported over to the new system.

A list of all the current tests are in the documentation.
