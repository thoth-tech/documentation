IIIF Course Review

Overview

<https://training.iiif.io/iiif-online-workshop/>

Day 1 : Introduction

With this Day/Page was a simple overview of what IIIF is and hows it being used in multiple
university and archives. Main points from this day are that the IIIF is made up of two main parts,
First being the Image API and the second being Presentaion API. The premise is that the Image API
will allow users to zoom and have a high quality image to display on their web-page. Presentaion API
is a way for users to create a collection of images that will create a manifest "book" style gallery
where there could be a image for each page of a book. Presentaion API also allows for the use of
annotation of images and selected areas.

Day 2 : Image API

Within this Day you will learn the basics of how to format an Image file to a URL and then the
different sections of the URL and how they can be manipulated to change the view of the image. These
sections consist of Identifier : The specific code that is given to each unique image.

Region : Allows the user to capture/include only a segment of the image.

Size : Allows the user to adjust the size of the image to best suit their needs.

Rotation : Allows users to rotate and flip the image.

Quality : Allows the user to select the colour type of the image between Default , Grey, Bitonal and
colour.

Format : jpg, png, tif, gif

Day 3 : Presentaion API

This Day you will work with the image which you had made into an Image API/URL. Allowing you to
create a manifest in which you can have multiple images with the singular link. You will also be
able to add titles and annotations.

Day 4 : Annotations

Within this part you will learn how to annotate an image as a whole or annotate only a section which
may be selected and then zoomed for better viewing

Questions

What Image types : Best to use either JGPEG 2000 or Pyramid Tiff this will allow for the image to be
scaled correctly for best zoom results.

DAMS/Repositories/Hosted Service(KloKan, Digirati)

IIP Server or Host our own : After doing research it would be best for us to create our database
of images which we can upload a manifest too, however, Amazon have a service that is quite
affordable, being only 1\$ per month for 1000 images.
