# Indigenous Art Gallery

## Documentation Content Discussion

### Preamble

This document was created during a series of interviews with the delivery leads of the art gallery
project.

An interesting idea that came from these sessions: consider the possibility of using the knowledge
base as a handover document.

### Testing - James Burden

- Testing methodologies, including technology stacks involved. Technologies will change during the
  transfer to Ruby, so it’s important to show reasoning behind decisions (such as through archival
  research).
- Testing types document.
- Further testing in the future (footprint document).

### Lighthouse/Front-end Enhancement - Rhonda Jorgensen

- Integrating lighthouse into the GitHub workflow, as it takes a long time to identify which team is
  responsible for each element.
  - So, what is needed is knowledge about other teams, by creating a space where individual elements
    can be placed for other teams to claim and fix rather than the Lighthouse Project attempting to
    fix it without any knowledge of the reasoning behind its properties.
- Rhonda is creating/wants a GitHub how-to document that is accessible and simple for newer and all
  members to be able to go through for support. Some of the current documentation can be confusing,
  so having a document with clear instructions and screenshots would go a long way in getting people
  to contribute to the repository.
- Rhonda has created a Lighthouse onboarding document, so depending on how it is formatted it could
  just be transferred immediately onto the knowledge base.

### Dockerisation/Deployment - Chloe Hulme

- How to set up and use docker. Whether external or internal information, having it all in one spot
  is important.
- Troubleshooting and technical support for docker.
- Document of future improvements, ideas that haven’t been completed, a footprint of future
  intentions (term: footprint document).

### Cyber Security - Domonic Ryzner

- This project is mainly documentation over technical knowledge.
- A documents subcategory, alongside a incomplete research-based category, like “research for
  implementation”, “research for development”. Alternatively, this could be formatted as a single
  footprint document.
- Security review documents with best practices, project-wide cyber security best members practices,
  and response practices.
