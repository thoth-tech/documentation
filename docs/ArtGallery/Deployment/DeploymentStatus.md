# Mid-Trimester Deployment Update (17/8/23)

Author: Chloe Hulme

## Introduction

This document serves as an update on the progress made regarding the deployment of the Indigenous
Art Gallery. As part of our continuous efforts to put our best foot forward regarding our deployment
processes, we have chosen Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and GitHub Actions as our deployment and CI/CD
tools. In this document, you will find details about our chosen tools, the current status of our GCP
usage approval, and what we can expect moving forward.

## Deployment Tools

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

After liaising with all stakeholders, we have selected Google Cloud Platform as our cloud
infrastructure provider for deploying and hosting our product. GCP offers a wide range of services
and resources that align well with our development and scalability needs. This choice enables us to
leverage GCP's robust features for seamless deployment, automatic scaling, and reliable performance.
As an added benefit, we will be able to make use of the partnership between Deakin and GCP.

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is our chosen continuous integration and deployment platform. It provides an
integrated workflow for automating tasks, including building, testing, and deploying our application
directly from our GitHub repository. This integration streamlines our development process, ensuring
that changes are thoroughly tested and deployed efficiently.

## GCP Usage Approval Status

Recently we have taken a significant step toward utilising GCP for our deployment needs. I have
submitted the necessary paperwork to request approval for our GCP usage from the school of IT staff.
As of today (17/8/23) I have received confirmation that our request is under review. The review
process is an essential step in ensuring compliance, security, and optimal resource allocation.

## Next Steps

1. **Review Process Completion**: We will await the completion of the GCP usage review. The school
   of IT staff will assess our request to ensure it aligns with the university's requirements and
   policies - particularly pertaining to cybersecurity.

2. **Feedback and Approval**: We may receive feedback or inquiries from the review team. If any
   additional information or clarifications are needed, we will promptly provide them to expedite
   the approval process.

3. **Deployment Planning**: We will use the remaining time this trimester to refine our deployment
   strategy. We will continue working on optimising our GitHub Actions workflows including
   developing sample code for future cohorts to use as a reference point; and ensuring that our
   application is ready for deployment in the coming trimester once we receive the green light.

## Stay Informed

As we progress through the GCP usage approval process, I will keep the team informed about any
updates or changes. If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions, please feel free to reach
out - and thank you to the eployment team your consisten efforts and hard work!
