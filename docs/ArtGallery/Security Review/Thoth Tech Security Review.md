Security Review

Overview

**_Scope:_**

Thoth Tech is creating an Art Gallery for Indigenous art to be displayed
and bought, there are different stages in which security will need to be
escalated. First stages is the development of the Front and Back End,
during the process of development it is crucial to use new and secure
versions of software, to ensure that coding are ensuring best practices.
With the completion of this product we have to ensure that we have a
secure method of allowing users to purchase items from sellers without
having their data being breached.

**_Assets:_**

-Domain

-Website

-Products/Art

-Media Accounts

-User Data

**_Current Security:_**

Currently, we are still developing the applications so there is no
current security level. Therefore the purpose of this review is a
baseline in which once the application is running, this document can be
used to help review the system and then increase the security where
needed.

**_Vulnerabilities:_**

Possible vulnerabilities within this project would be the level of
authentication, whether it is decided that the public can view and use
the application or if an account is needed to purchase an item or to
view the application. If login is needed then we must create a secure
login system, as mentioned in the client meeting it would be best to use
the already existing deakin login portal as it would be secure it would
also be easy to implement. Another vulnerability that this project may
face is with the method of purchasing items, this leads into multiple
categories, secure method of purchasing items from the website, with the
multiple methods of payments such as credit card, paypal, afterpay,
zippay e.t.c. Then there is the keeping the users data secure during
processing.

**_Recommendations:_**

As the company is a strictly online business at the moment majority of
the recommendations would be the basics of website design and coding
practices. Depending on the company\'s choice with the login system, it
would be best to use a secure login page that would be held within a
data base. With the later addition of a payment system that would be one
area that will need the most security as we will be handling users
sensitive information. Thus we must use the best practices for secure
payment, encryption, multi-factor authentication, if possible have a
system to flag and monitor any suspicious activity.

**_Implementation of Recommendations:_**

With the implementation of the recommendations with where the project is
at, the biggest one for all contributors would be to use latest versions
of the software that is possible, and if any older out of data software
is used it would be beneficial to change the software to newer methods
(this is something that is already being done within the company).
