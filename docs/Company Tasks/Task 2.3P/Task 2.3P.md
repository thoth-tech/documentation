## Executive Summary

Thoth Tech (est. 2022) is a new software development company currently building
from the ground up in Melbourne Australia. Thoth Tech’s mission is to build,
operate, and deploy education technologies, creating tools that enhance education
outcomes by empowering students, connecting them with tutors, and facilitating
personalised learning experiences. We value our people, and we value excellence:
We are people-focused, aim to produce sustainable products of excellent quality,

of our team.

This report is for stakeholders, investors, and employees, and will outline the
company structure, charter, objectives – both short and long term, and explore
each product’s goals in depth.

Within the first third of 2022, Thoth Tech has recruited approximately 92 employees
including four area leads, three product leads and eleven delivery leads.

The second third of 2022 has seen Thoth Tech grow to approximately 104 employees,
including five product leads and sixteen delivery leads.

There will be another recruitment phase during the last third of the year, with the
potential for internships throughout the company.

Along with recruitment, Thoth Tech has taken onboard three external products, two
live and well-established products – OnTrack and SplashKit – and DreamBig, a in
development product which will leverage the OnTrack technology stack. Thoth Tech
will also be creating our internal architecture and platform for employees throughout
this third of the year, referred to as the Internal System project.

Both the OnTrack and SplashKit products have been identified as requiring extensions
and additional features to improve the quality and usability of the product. OnTrack
is a platform designed to facilitate student learning and reducing the pressure of
achieving unrealistic grades. The focus is on providing a tailored learning experience,
using tasks and a portfolio assessment. This product is live and is currently being
upgraded to newer technology stacks and improving security and documentation. SplashKit
is currently a 2D game development Software Development Kit used to teach object-oriented
coding to beginners. It has been identified that SplashKit can be expanded to explore
other areas and languages. The DreamBig product is in response to a need identified
by Deakin,to provide a personalised development roadmaps to enhance students’ employability.
Due to a partnership with the School of IT at Deakin University, Thoth Tech and
the subsequent products are funded, supported, and leveraged by Deakin. However,
all contributions by Thoth Tech members are acknowledged due to the Open-Source
nature of the company. Deakin provides ground zero end-user testing and focus groups
for product improvements.

## SplashKit

SplashKit is an open-source Software Development Kit (SDK), created with the purpose
of reducing the overhead required for truly technical coding and allowing students
new to coding to create satisfying programs in a short period of time.

SplashKit enables beginning coders to quickly learn to construct fun and functional
programs which they can be proud to showcase. SplashKit is an open-source Software

to construct fun and functional programs which they can be proud to showcase.
It includes a large library of functions which can be utilized by the user to
experiment and apply for their own application or game.  

This product is currently
used by the students at Deakin University and aims to become a global educational
toolkit. Currently the language used for development is C++ and the direction of
the product is to improve and expand the capabilities to increase SplashKit accessibility.

## Applications - Arcade Machine

### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

This trimester, the arcade machine team has a solid foundation to build on, given
the creation of a Windows application capable of cloning the games repository,
and executing the games on a playable interface. The work of last trimester allows
the team of this trimester to take closer steps to creating a physical arcade machine.
The machine will perform similarly to a Multi-Game Arcade Machine, allowing users
to select a game from a local library of games. Objectives include:

o Software which:

- Is cross platform compatible
- Allows for game compilation on the host machine  
- Is authored to be consistent with a chosen programming convention/style guide  
- Implements an architecture that ensures long term maintainability is possible for
      future contributors  

o The development of:

- A programming convention / style guide document
- Other General Prject Documentation

o Research of:

- Appropriate tooling that can be used to assist with these objectives
- Unit tests and determining if they have any value for the project

Additional features which may be considered later in the lifecycle of the project include the development and deployment of a website which:

o Supports the uploading of games  
o Stores and displays:

- User Reviews  
- High Scores and Achievements  

### Aims for Trimester

The primary aim of this trimester is to enhance the exisitng application to accomodate cross-platform compatibility. This will include developing methods to faciliate the compilation of games on the host machine. Access to the game library will be offered through the platform where the user can configure settings and select and play their desired game. If time permits, a physical Arcade Machine will be designed and manufactured however the software platform is the primary focus for the trimester.  

### Deliverables

#### Short-term

o Decoupling functional behaviour and modularising existing software  
o Adding support for all three major operating systems  
o Adding support for locally compiled games on the host machine  
o Completion of an options menu  
o Discussing and agreeing upon a programming convention and style  
o Addressing style inconsistencies throughout the project’s source code  
o Producing documentation around the project  

#### Long-term

o Physical Arcade Machine built using RaspberryPi

## Applications - Build An Exceptional Game

### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

This trimester, this team will collaborate as a unit to create a single game of exceptional class and quality.  

The goal is to make a game so good it is worthy of commercial release game. The intension here is to showcase to the world, the power of the SplashKit SDK, and encourage developers to develop games using the engine. This trimesters student developers will aim to utilise as many methods that SplashKit has to offer in order to ‘advertise’ SplashKit’s ability as a game engine.

The long-term objectives will showcase how by using SplashKit, game development quality can be achieved such that the product created is of a high enough professional standard, the game can be made available commercially. Syncronously, the game will be showcased on the arcade machine in development.

### Aims for Trimester

The aim for this trimester is to

- Compartmentalise the tasks to focus teams on specific areas of games development (Design, Mechanics, Animations, Collisions, AI, etc)
- Construct UML and foundational designs and specifications
- Acquire artwork and sound assets suitable to specifications
- Develop the foundations of the game
- Create game functionality, intro animations, menu, options, credits, etc

### Deliverables

#### Short-term

- A decided genre of game
- UML Class diagrams and other designs
- Team creations and task allocations
- Acquisition of assets
- Class creation
- Documentation

#### Long-term

- Commercially releasable game, developed using the Splashkit SDK
