## SplashKit: Modules Enhancements

### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

The Splashkit modules team has an exciting semester ahead of them, with each module in a position to
have deliverable components completed.

The machine learning module had a working reinforcement learning agent that can play turn based
games. Refactoring and code review was performed on the physics module, but external dependencies on
the Box2D library has left the module requiring a major refactor. This refactor would mean that
Splashkit would contain a native physics engine. The data analytics module has a structure for a
dataframe, pending it passing code review and testing.

Objectives for the modules project include:

- Building multiple machine learning agents utilising different algorithms to be used by developers
  for different features
- Create a 2D physics engine within SplashKit, allowing physics to be easily added to objects within
  a project
- Implement a dataframe structure that loads structured data and create an API that allows a data
  scientist to pre-process, transform and visualise the data.

With the addition of these modules, there is potential for Splashkit to be utilised in a greater
capacity within more disciplines. Building the data analytics module allows for more focused classes
to be designed for data science students, rather than only using Splashkit for building games. Both
the physics and machine learning modules will advance the quality and capability of games and
animations built while using Splashkit.

### Aims for Trimester

The primary aim for this trimester is to have the reinforcement learning agent ready to use by
developers and to complete the first stage of deliverables for the physics and data analytics
modules. These initial deliverables are to complete the basic dataframe for data analytics and to
replace the existing Box2D library uses with native methods.

Secondary aims for the semester are to create a neural network agent, develop plots and
visualisations from the data in the dataframes and to begin creating methods for gravity, sinking
and projectile motion.
