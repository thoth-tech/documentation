## User Stories
* As a student I want a machine with the ability to play my game creations so that I can showcase and share them with my peers.
* As a student I want to be able to have a guide so I can figure out how to use the machine and how I can get my game on the machine
* As a creator I want to know that I can safely upload my games without them being stolen or re uploaded to other sources so that I can continue to have it as an individual title.
* As a creator I want a server with the capability to update and deploy iterations of my game so that I can showcase it
